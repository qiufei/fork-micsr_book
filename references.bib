                  usually asked to select their most preferred option
                  from a set. Preferences can be estimated more
                  efficiently if respondents are asked to rank all

                  perform the ranking task, using the complete ranking
                  may lead to a substantial bias. We introduce a model

                  capabilities of individuals. Estimated preferences
                  based on this model are more efficient when at least
                  some individuals are able to rank more than one
                  item, and they do not suffer from biases due to

                  from which existing intercity travelers will be

                  a critical part of evaluating alternative travel
                  service proposals to alleviate intercity travel
                  congestion. This paper develops a new
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model of intercity
                  mode choice that overcomes the ‘independence of
                  irrelevant alternatives’ (IIA) property of the
                  commonly used multinomial logit model. The proposed
                  model allows a more flexible cross-elasticity
                  structure among alternatives than the nested logit
                  model. It is also simple, intuitive and much less of
                  a computational burden than the multinomial probit
                  model. The paper discusses the non-IIA property of
                  the heteroscedastic extreme value model and presents
                  an efficient and accurate Gaussian quadrature
                  technique to estimate the heteroscedastic model
                  using the maximum likelihood method. The multinomial
                  logit, alternative nested logit structures, and the
                  heteroscedastic model are estimated to examine the
                  impact of improved rail service on business travel
                  in the Toronto-Montreal corridor. The nested logit
                  structures are either inconsistent with utility
                  maximization principles or are not significantly
                  better than the multinomial logit model. The
                  heteroscedastic extreme value model, however, is
                  found to be superior to the multinomial logit
                  model. The heteroscedastic model predicts smaller
                  increases in rail shares and smaller decreases in
                  non-rail shares than the multinomial logit in
                  response to rail-service improvements. It also
                  suggests a larger percentage decrease in air share
                  and a smaller percentage decrease in auto share than
                  the multinomial logit. Thus, the multinomial logit
                  model is likely to provide overly optimistic
                  projections of rail ridership and revenue, and of
                  alleviation in inter-city travel congestion in
                  general, and highway traffic congestion in
                  particular. These findings point to the limitations
                  of the multinomial logit and nested logit models in
                  studying intercity mode choice behavior and to the
                  usefulness of the heteroscedastic model proposed in

                  of pairs of alternatives. This restriction is
                  inappropriate for many choice situations; those in
                  which some pairs or sets of alternatives share the
                  same unobserved attributes. The nested logit (NL)
                  model relaxes the zero covariance restriction of the
                  MNL model but imposes the restriction of equal
                  covariance among all alternatives in a common nest
                  and zero covariance otherwise. The paired
                  combinatorial logit (PCL) model relaxes these
                  restrictions further by allowing different
                  covariances for each pair of alternatives. This

                  structure, compared to the MNL model and NL models,
                  enables better representation of many choice

abstract = {Abstract In economic research, it is often important to
                  express the marginal value of a variable in monetary
                  terms. In random coefficient models, this marginal
                  monetary value is the ratio of two random
                  coefficients and is thus random itself. In this
                  paper, we study the distribution of this ratio and
                  particularly the consequences of different
                  distributional assumptions about the
                  coefficients. It is shown that important
                  characteristics of the distribution of the marginal
                  monetary value may be sensitive to the
                  distributional assumptions about the random
                  coefficients. The median, however, is much less
                  sensitive than the mean. Copyright 2006 John Wiley

abstract = {Abstract In this paper we propose a dynamic multinomial
                  probit model in order to estimate the long-run and
                  short- run effects of marketing mix variables on
                  brand choice. The latent variables, which contain
                  the unobserved perceived utilities, follow a
                  first-order vector error correction autoregressive
                  process of order 1 with current and lagged
                  explanatory variables. The unrestricted
                  autoregressive parameter matrix concerns the
                  intertemporal correlation in perceived utilities of
                  households over purchase occasions and indicates the
                  persistence in brand choice. As explanatory
                  variables we consider relative prices and
                  promotional activities like feature and display. An
                  important and novel feature of our model is that it
                  allows for different long-run and short-run effects
                  of promotional activities, thereby extending the
                  models that are currently available in the
                  literature. Additionally, to account for different
                  base preferences for brands across households, we
                  allow for consumer heterogeneity. Our application
                  concerns a panel of households choosing among
                  several brands of a FMCG. Our estimated model turns
                  out to be an improvement over a static model and
                  over a model with only short-run effects, in terms
                  of in-sample fit and out-of-sample

 abstract = {This paper considers mixed, or random coefficients,
                  multinomial logit (MMNL) models for discrete
                  response, and establishes the following
                  results. Under mild regularity conditions, any
                  discrete choice model derived from random utility
                  maximization has choice probabilities that can be
                  approximated as closely as one pleases by a MMNL
                  model. Practical estimation of a parametric mixing
                  family can be carried out by Maximum Simulated
                  Likelihood Estimation or Method of Simulated
                  Moments, and easily computed instruments are
                  provided that make the latter procedure fairly
                  efficient. The adequacy of a mixing specification
                  can be tested simply as an omitted variable test
                  with appropriately defined artificial variables. An
                  application to a problem of demand for alternative
                  vehicles shows that MMNL provides a flexible and
                  computationally practical approach to discrete

                  allowing the parameters to vary randomly over
                  individuals according to a continuous, discrete, or
                  discrete-continuous mixture distribution, which must

                  increasingly being used to allow for random
                  heterogeneity in willingness to pay (WTP)
                  measures. In the most commonly used specifications,
                  the distribution of WTP for an attribute is derived
                  from the distribution of the ratio of individual
                  coefficients. Since the cost coefficient enters the
                  denominator, its distribution plays a major role in
                  the distribution of WTP. Depending on the choice of
                  distribution for the cost coefficient, and its
                  implied range, the distribution of WTP may or may
                  not have finite moments. In this paper, we identify
                  a criterion to determine whether, with a given
                  distribution for the cost coefficient, the
                  distribution of WTP has finite moments. Using this
                  criterion, we show that some popular distributions
                  used for the cost coefficient in random coefficient
                  models, including normal, truncated normal, uniform
                  and triangular, imply infinite moments for the
                  distribution of WTP, even if truncated or bounded at
                  zero. We also point out that relying on simulation
                  approaches to obtain moments of WTP from the
                  estimated distribution of the cost and attribute
                  coefficients can mask the issue by giving finite
                  moments when the true ones are infinite.",

We assume that households have heterogeneous expectations on the distribution of excess returns and that they cannot take short positions in risky assets. Assuming two such assets, we derive an explicit solution of the model characterized by four possible portfolio regimes, which are analyzed using two structural probit and tobit specifications with three latent state variables. Both specifications are estimated by weighted maximum likelihood on a cross-section of US households drawn from the 2004 SCF. The tobit specification is simulated in order to evaluate the regressors' effects on regime probabilities and asset demands. We also assess to what extent the predicted state variables are consistent with the self-reported expected returns and risk aversion elicited from the SCF questionnaire.

Dutch households' portfolios exhibit low degrees of risk taking and diversification. It is possible that this is the outcome of a rational, precautionary response to unavoidable exposure to background risk (stemming from the labour market or health conditions, etc.). We consider as alternative explanations liquidity needs and habits. The endogenous variable is the fraction of clearly safe in total financial assets at the household level. Parametric and semi-parametric censored regression models for pooled cross-sections and random and fixed effects models for panel data show that both heteroscedasticity and unobserved heterogeneity are of major importance in the data. With subjective indicators of income uncertainty we find a limited role for precautionary motives. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper reports results of an extensive analysis of statistical demand functions for food using household survey data and aggregate time-series data on food consumption in the USA and The Netherlands. Using the model put forward by Tobin (1950) for survey data, we find that socio-economic information on the composition, education, and status of households adds little to the explanation of food consumption. The income elasticity of food consumption decreases over time in the USA but increases in The Netherlands. Applying multivariate cointegration analysis to the time-series data, we find that strict price homogeneity, structural stability, and weak exogeneity of prices have to be rejected statistically at conventional significance levels, whereas weak exogeneity of food consumption cannot be rejected. The long-run income elasticity tends to decrease over time for US data and is roughly constant for Dutch data. The findings corroborate earlier findings for the survey data. The rejection of price exogeneity is consistent with Tobin's model which treats prices as endogenous. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = { Categorical and limited dependent variable models are
                  routinely estimated via maximum likelihood. It is
                  well-known that the ML estimates of the parameters
                  are inconsistent if the distribution or the
                  skedastic component is misspecified. When
                  conditional moment tests were first developed by
                  Newey (1985) and Tauchen (1985), they appeared to
                  offer a wide range of easy-to-compute specification
                  tests for categorical and limited dependent variable
                  models estimated by maximum likelihood. However,
                  subsequent studies found that using the asymptotic
                  critical values produced severe size
                  distortions. This paper presents simulation evidence
                  that the standard conditional moment test for
                  normality after tobit estimation has essentially no
                  size distortion and reasonable power when the
                  critical values are obtained via a parametric
                  bootstrap. }

  abstract={The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of the analysis of two kinds of data structures used in contemporary econometric research: cross section data and panel data. The book covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particularly methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models, multinomial and ordered choice models, Tobit models and two-part extensions, models for count data, various censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effect estimation, and duration analysis. Control function and correlated random effects approaches are expanded to allow estimation of complicated models in the presence of endogeneity and heterogeneity. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster sampling problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of \&quot;generalized instrumental variables\&quot; (GIV) estimation; new coverage of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with assumptions concerning the intervention and different data structures, including panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the \&quot;generalized estimating equation\&quot; literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain “obvious” procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper outlines an approach to Bayesian semiparametric regression in multiple equation models which can be used to carry out inference in seemingly unrelated regressions or simultaneous equations models with nonparametric components. The approach treats the points on each nonparametric regression line as unknown parameters and uses a prior on the degree of smoothness of each line to ensure valid posterior inference despite the fact that the number of parameters is greater than the number of observations. We develop an empirical Bayesian approach that allows us to estimate the prior smoothing hyperparameters from the data. An advantage of our semiparametric model is that it is written as a seemingly unrelated regressions model with independent normal–Wishart prior. Since this model is a common one, textbook results for posterior inference, model comparison, prediction and posterior computation are immediately available. We use this model in an application involving a two-equation structural model drawn from the labour and returns to schooling literatures. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the implications of the theory of irreversible investment under uncertainty for investment in oil fields on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS). We consider the problem of an operator who owns a licence to develop and extract oil from a field of known capacity. An intertemporal optimization model in discrete time is developed to derive decision rules for the timing of the irreversible development investment and for the optimal rate of extraction. Model simulation is then used to describe the properties of the numerical solutions. The predictions of the theory on the determinants of the irreversible investment decision are then examined using statistical duration analysis. Data on the length of the time period between discovery and development are available for individual fields on the UKCS. We measure the duration of the irreversible investment gestation lag for each field and test the model by assessing the significance of the theoretical variables in explaining the significance of such a lag. Both our theoretical model and our empirical results suggest the importance of a nonlinear interaction of the level of oil prices and the volatility of oil prices in determining the development lag. The simulation of our theoretical model shows a nonlinear impact of oil price volatility on the trigger level of oil prices. Our empirical results suggest that the effect of price volatility is a function of the expected price level, with increased price volatility having a positive impact on the duration of investment appraisal when expected prices are low and a negative impact when they are high.},

The procedure—local polynomial regression clustering—first estimates a nonparametric model via local polynomial regression, and then identifies the underlying classes by aggregating sample observations into data clusters with similar estimates of the (local) functional relationships between dependent and independent variables. Finally, parametric functions specific to each class are estimated. The technique is applied to the estimation of a multiple-class hedonic model for wine, resulting in the identification of four distinct wine classes based on differences in implicit prices of the attributes.

Our starting point is a study of three definitions related to quadratic measures of variation. We discuss the properties of these statistics, and show that the family can be extended in a natural way by a fourth statistic with an even simpler interpretation, namely the difference between the averages of fitted values for successes and failures, respectively. We propose the name "the coefficient of discrimination" for this statistic, and recommend its use as a standard measure of explanatory power. In its intuitive interpretation, this quantity has no immediate relation to the classical versions of R², but it turns out to be related to these by two exact relations, which imply that all these statistics are asymptotically equivalent.},

The theme of the survey is that while there is no obvious criterion for choosing which Pseudo-R2 to use, if the estimation is in the context of an underlying latent dependent variable model, a case can be made for basing the choice on the strength of the numerical relationship to the OLS-R2 in the latent dependent variable. As such an OLS-R2 can be known in a Monte Carlo simulation, we summarize Monte Carlo results for some important latent dependent variable models (binary probit, ordinal probit and Tobit) and find that a Pseudo-R2 measure due to McKelvey and Zavoina scores consistently well under our criterion. We also very briefly discuss Pseudo-R2 measures for count data, for duration models and for prediction-realization tables.},

This estimator can be calculated by applying GLS to estimates of the reduced form coefficients that are obtained by using reduced form residuals as additional explanatory variables. It is also shown that it is possible to obtain asymptotically efficient estimators of the other coefficients by a modified minimum chi-square method.}

abstract = {Summary The purpose of this paper is to provide guidelines for empirical researchers who use a class of bivariate threshold crossing models with dummy endogenous variables. A common practice employed by the researchers is the specification of the joint distribution of unobservables as a bivariate normal distribution, which results in a bivariate probit model. To address the problem of misspecification in this practice, we propose an easy-to-implement semiparametric estimation framework with parametric copula and nonparametric marginal distributions. We establish asymptotic theory, including root-n normality, for the sieve maximum likelihood estimators that can be used to conduct inference on the individual structural parameters and the average treatment effect (ATE). In order to show the practical relevance of the proposed framework, we conduct a sensitivity analysis via extensive Monte Carlo simulation exercises. The results suggest that estimates of the parameters, especially the ATE, are sensitive to parametric specification, while semiparametric estimation exhibits robustness to underlying data-generating processes. We then provide an empirical illustration where we estimate the effect of health insurance on doctor visits. In this paper, we also show that the absence of excluded instruments may result in identification failure, in contrast to what some practitioners believe.},

Since a variety of other economic data come in the form of repeated counts of some individual actions or events, the methodology should have wide applications. The statistical models we develop are applications and generalizations of Poisson distribution. Two important issues are (i) Given the panel nature of our data, how can we allow for separate persistent individual (fixed or random) effects? (ii) How does one introduce the equivalent of disturbances-in-the-equation into the analysis of Poisson and other discrete probability functions? The first problem is solved by conditioning on the total sum of outcomes over the observed years, while the second problem is solved by introducing an additional source of randomness, allowing the Poisson parameter to be itself randomly distributed, and compounding the two distributions. Lastly, we develop a test statistic for the presence of serial correlation when fixed effects estimators are used in nonlinear conditional models.},

abstract = {Count data regression models are extended to account for endogenous switching and its two most common incarnations, viz., endogenous dummy variables (treatment effects) and sample selection. Fully parametric and partially parametric versions of the extended model are discussed. In the parametric version of the model, a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) approach to estimation is introduced. Under the correct model specification the FIML estimator is efficient but computationally burdensome. For the relatively robust partially parametric version of the model I develop a two-stage method of moments (TSM) estimator. The TSM estimator is a nonlinear least-squares analog to the popular Heckman (1976, 1979) estimator and therefore avoids the computational requirements of FIML estimation. A nonlinear weighted least-squares (NWLS) estimator is offered for the fully parametric case. The NWLS estimator is computationally efficient relative to FIML estimation, and statistically efficient relative to the TSM estimator. For illustrative purposes the TSM and NWLS estimators are applied to the estimation of a regression model with household trip frequency as the dependent variable and a potentially endogenous dummy variable indicating vehicle ownership among the regressors.}

 abstract = {In this article a method for obtaining tests for overdispersion with respect to a natural exponential family is derived. The tests are designed to be powerful against arbitrary alternative mixture models where only the first two moments of the mixed distribution are specified. Various tests for extra-Poisson and extra-binomial variation are obtained as special cases; the use of a particular test may be motivated by a consideration of the mechanism through which the overdispersion may arise. The common occurrence of extra-Poisson and extra-binomial variation has been noted by several authors. However, the Poisson and binomial models remain valid in many instances and, because of their simplicity and appeal, it is of real interest to ascertain when they apply. This paper develops a unifying theory for testing for overdispersion and generalizes tests previously derived, including those by Fisher (1950), Collings and Margolin (1985), and Prentice (1986). It also shows the Pearson statistic to be a score test for overdispersion in a certain situation.},

These alternatives permit more flexible specification of the data-generating process (dgp) than do familiar count data models (e.g., the Poisson), and provide a natural means for modeling data that are over- or underdispersed by the standards of the basic models. In the cases considered, the familiar forms of the distributions result as parameter-restricted versions of the proposed modified distributions. Accordingly, score tests of the restrictions that use only the easily-computed ML estimates of the standard models are proposed. The tests proposed by Hausman (1978) and White (1982) are also considered. The tests are then applied to count data models estimated using survey microdata on beverage consumption.}

 abstract = {Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a model for count data with excess zeros. It assumes that with probability p the only possible observation is 0, and with probability 1 - p, a Poisson(λ) random variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson(λ) distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state and the mean number of defects λ in the imperfect state may depend on covariates. Sometimes p and λ are unrelated; other times p is a simple function of λ such as p=1/(1+λ τ) for an unknown constant τ. In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's. Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but also why the means are lower.},

 abstract={Sandwich covariance matrix estimators are a popular tool in applied regression modeling for performing inference that is robust to certain types of model misspecification. Suitable implementations are available in the R system for statistical computing for certain model fitting functions only (in particular &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;lm()&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;), but not for other standard regression functions, such as &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;glm()&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;nls()&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;survreg()&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. Therefore, conceptual tools and their translation to computational tools in the package sandwich are discussed, enabling the computation of sandwich estimators in general parametric models. Object orientation can be achieved by providing a few extractor functions’ most importantly for the empirical estimating functions’ from which various types of sandwich estimators can be computed.},

I treat the introduction of Napster as a technological event that only Internet users experienced, and use a difference-in-differences (DD) approach. Because of potential compositional changes in Internet users, I examine identifying assumptions for the DD estimator under compositional changes and develop a test for identifying restrictions. To address potential bias due to compositional changes, I extend DD matching estimators to the case of two-variate propensity scores. I find evidence suggesting that file sharing is likely to explain 20% of total sales decline, which is driven by households with children aged 6—17.},

Following a terrorist attack on the main Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, all Jewish institutions received police protection. Thus, this hideous event induced a geographical allocation of police forces that can be presumed exogenous in a crime regression. Using data on the location of car thefts before and after the attack, we find a large deterrent effect of observable police on crime. The effect is local, with no appreciable impact outside the narrow area in which the police are deployed.},

Results for the USA, based on quasi-experimental evidence, suggest that a TWA assignment decreases the probability of finding a stable job, while results for Europe, based on the conditional independence assumption (CIA), typically reach opposite conclusions. Using data for two Italian regions, we rely on a matching estimator to show that TWA assignments can be an effective springboard to permanent employment. We also propose a simulation-based sensitivity analysis, which highlights that only for one of these two regions are our results robust to specific failures of the CIA. We conclude that European studies based on the CIA should not be automatically discarded, but should be put under the scrutiny of a sensitivity analysis like the one we propose.},

 abstract = {This article uses propensity score methods to estimate the treatment impact of the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, a labor training program, on postintervention earnings. We use data from Lalonde's evaluation of nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable preintervention variables.},

The synthetic control method provides a systematic way to choose comparison units in comparative case studies. This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small‐sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows researchers to put “qualitative flesh on quantitative bones.” We illustrate the main ideas behind the synthetic control method by estimating the economic impact of the 1990 German reunification on West Germany.},

It relies on a semi‐parametric identification strategy that controls for the confounding effects of past gross domestic product (GDP) dynamics, anticipation effects, unobserved heterogeneity, model uncertainty, and effect heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that secession lowered per capita GDP, on average by around 24\% in the 10th post‐independence year. Nevertheless, the associated cross‐sectional standard deviation of 25\% emphasizes that the economic impact of secession also varied widely across countries. A novel procedure to produce confidence intervals around synthetic control estimates of treatment effects demonstrates the statistical significance of the findings. We document the implications for several historical independence waves and connect them to the existing literature. We find tentative evidence that, in decreasing order of relative importance, the adverse effects of independence are disproportionally present in non‐oil producing landlocked countries and are mitigated when newly independent states use their new‐found political autonomy to democratize or to liberalize their trade regime.},

The results indicate that UK exports to EU countries may have lost nearly 25\% by early 2018, due to the Brexit shock, somewhat more than those to non‐EU countries. Imports from the EU and non‐EU countries also declined a little, although there is tentative evidence that UK consumers may have been avoiding countries with preferential trade agreements (PTAs) with the EU, and possibly turning towards the Commonwealth. Overall, the results confirm that policy uncertainty has a major effect upon trade and that uncertainty about supply chain costs is a potential explanation for at least some of the shortfall.},

 abstract = {We outline a framework for causal inference in settings where assignment to a binary treatment is ignorable, but compliance with the assignment is not perfect so that the receipt of treatment is nonignorable. To address the problems associated with comparing subjects by the ignorable assignment-an "intention-to-treat analysis"-we make use of instrumental variables, which have long been used by economists in the context of regression models with constant treatment effects. We show that the instrumental variables (IV) estimand can be embedded within the Rubin Causal Model (RCM) and that under some simple and easily interpretable assumptions, the IV estimand is the average causal effect for a subgroup of units, the compliers. Without these assumptions, the IV estimand is simply the ratio of intention-to-treat causal estimands with no interpretation as an average causal effect. The advantages of embedding the IV approach in the RCM are that it clarifies the nature of critical assumptions needed for a causal interpretation, and moreover allows us to consider sensitivity of the results to deviations from key assumptions in a straightforward manner. We apply our analysis to estimate the effect of veteran status in the Vietnam era on mortality, using the lottery number that assigned priority for the draft as an instrument, and we use our results to investigate the sensitivity of the conclusions to critical assumptions.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical growth model which explicitly takes into account technological interdependence among economies and examines the impact of spillover effects. Technological interdependence is assumed to operate through spatial externalities. The magnitude of the physical capital externalities at steady state, which is not usually identified in the literature, is estimated using a spatial econometric specification. Spatial externalities are found to be significant. This spatially augmented Solow model yields a conditional convergence equation which is characterized by parameter heterogeneity. A locally linear spatial autoregressive specification is then estimated providing a convergence speed estimate for each country of the sample.},

 abstract = {Conventional urban economic analysis suggests that a local economy's size is closely related to a number of features, including levels of human capital and the availability of specialized inputs, which are likely to influence positively the rate at which it accumulates further economic activity. At the same time, urban theory also suggests that once cities reach a certain level of size, these agglomeration benefits begin to peter out, while diseconomies rise rapidly. Consequently, we should see an 'inverted U-shaped' pattern of growth with respect to economic size-rates of growth first rise, then fall as size increases. This paper shows that, while such a pattern is largely absent from recent data on growth in metropolitan area population and employment, it emerges strikingly in county-level data.},

abstract = {The capabilities for visualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic information systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the “spatial” aspects of the data. The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

We argue that while many of these tests are produced in a Lagrange multiplier framework they are often more readily derived, and more easily applied, if approached from the conditional moment testing view of Newey (1985) and Tauchen (1985). In addition we propose some new tests based on comparisons of parametric estimators with nonparametric estimators which are consistent under certain forms of misspecification. To illustrate the utility of the tests we employ them in the examination of some existing published studies.},

To explore this question, I use data from shipping records and historical documents reporting slave ethnicities to construct estimates of the number of slaves exported from each country during Africa's slave trades. I find a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves exported from a country and current economic performance. To better understand if the relationship is causal, I examine the historical evidence on selection into the slave trades and use instrumental variables. Together the evidence suggests that the slave trades had an adverse effect on economic development.},

Local power is calculated for small departures from the null hypothesis.

The count model literature has generally assumed that unobservables and observed covariates are statistically independent. Yet for many applications this independence assumption is clearly tenuous. When the unobservables are omitted variables correlated with included regressors, standard estimation methods will generally be inconsistent. Though alternative consistent estimators may exist in special circumstances, it is suggested here that a nonlinear instrumental-variable strategy offers a reasonably general solution to such estimation problems. This approach is applied in two examples that focus on cigarette smoking behavior.},
