# Endogeneity {#sec-endogeneity}

The unbiasedness and the consistency of the OLS estimator rests on the
hypothesis that the conditional expectation of the error is constant
(and can safely be set to zero if the model contains an
intercept). Namely, starting with the simple linear model: $y_n = \alpha + \beta x_n + \epsilon_n$, $\mbox{E}(\epsilon \mid x) = 0$, or equivalently $\mbox{E}(y \mid x) = \alpha + \beta x_n$. The same property can also be described using the covariance between the covariate and the error that can be written, using the rule of repeated expectation:

$$
\mbox{cov}(x, \epsilon) = \mbox{E}\left((x - \mu_x)\epsilon\right) = 
\mbox{E}_x\left[\mbox{E}_\epsilon\left((x - \mu_x)\epsilon\mid
x\right)\right]
= \mbox{E}_x\left[(x - \mu_x)\mbox{E}_\epsilon\left(\epsilon\mid
x\right)\right]
$$

If the conditional expectation of $\epsilon$ is a constant
$\mbox{E}_\epsilon(\epsilon\mid x) = \mu_\epsilon$ (not necessary 0),
the covariance is $\mbox{cov}(x, \epsilon) = \mu_\epsilon \mbox{E}_x(x -
\mu_x) = 0$. Stated differently, $x$ is supposed to be exogenous, or $x$ is
assumed to be uncorrelated with $\epsilon$. This is a reasonable
assumption in an experimental setting, when the values of $x$ in a
sample are set by the researcher. Unfortunately, most of the data used in microeconometrics are not experimental, so that problem of endogeneity is severe. 

@sec-source_endog presents the circumstances where some covariates are endogenous. @sec-simple_iv presents the simple instrumental variable estimator (one endogenous covariate and one instrument), and @sec-general_iv extends this model to the case where there may be more than one endogenous covariate and several instruments. @sec-three_sls extends the estimation of systems of equation to the case where some of the covariates are endogenous. @sec-fixed_effects presents the fixed effects model. Finally, several testing procedures are presented in @sec-tests_endog.

## Sources of endogeneity {#sec-source_endog}

In economics, the problem of endogenous covariates happens mainly in three circumstances: errors in variables, omitted variables and simultaneity.

### errors in variables
\index[general]{errors in variables|(}

Data used in economics, especially micro-data are prone to errors
of measurement. This problem can affect either the response or some of
the covariates. Suppose that the model that we seek to estimate is:
$y^*_n = \alpha + \beta x^*_n + \epsilon^*_n$, where the covariate is exogenous, which implies that $\mbox{cov}(x^*,
\epsilon^*)=0$. Suppose that the response is observed with error,
namely that the observed value of the response is $y_n = y ^*_n +
\nu_n$, where $\nu_n$ is the measurement error of the response. In
terms of the observed response, the model is now:

$$
y_n = \alpha + \beta x_n ^ * + (\epsilon^*_n + \nu_n)
$$

The error of the estimable model is then $\epsilon_n = \epsilon^*_n +
\nu_n$ which is still uncorrelated with $x$ if $\nu$ is uncorrelated
with $x$, which means that the error of measurement of the response is
uncorrelated with the covariate. In this case, the measurement error
only increases the size of the error, which implies that the
coefficients are estimated less precisely and that the R^2^ is lower
compared to a model with a correctly measured response. 

Now consider that the covariate is measured with error and that the
observable values of the covariate is $x_n = x_n ^ * + \nu_n$. If the
measurement error is uncorrelated with the value of the covariate, the
variance of the observed covariate is therefore $\sigma_x ^ 2 =
\sigma_x ^ {*2} + \sigma_\nu ^ 2$. Moreover, the covariance between the observed covariate and the
measurement error is equal to the variance of the measurement error:
$\sigma_{x\nu} = \mbox{E} \left((x ^ * + \nu - \mu_x)
\nu\right) = \sigma_\nu ^ 2$, 
because the measurement error is uncorrelated with the covariate.
Rewriting the model in terms of $x$, we get:
$y_n = \alpha + \beta x_n + \epsilon_n$, with $\epsilon_n = \epsilon_n  ^ *- \beta \nu_n$.
The error of this model is now correlated with $x$, as $\mbox{cov}(x, \epsilon_n) = \mbox{cov}(x^* + \nu,\epsilon ^ * - \beta \nu) = - \beta \sigma_\nu ^ 2$. The OLS estimator can be written as usual as:

$$
\hat{\beta} = 
\frac{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x})(y_n - \bar{y})}{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x}) ^
2} =
\beta + \frac{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x})\epsilon_n}{\sum_n (x_n -
\bar{x}) ^ 2}
$$

Taking the expectations, we have $\mbox{E}\left[(x - \bar{x})
\epsilon\right] = -\beta \sigma_\nu ^ 2$ and the expected value of the
estimator is then:

$$
\mbox{E}(\hat{\beta}) = \beta\left(1 - \frac{\sigma_\nu ^ 2}{\sum (x_n
-\bar{x}) ^ 2 / N}\right)
= \beta\left(1 - \frac{\sigma_\nu ^ 2}{\hat{\sigma}_x ^ 2}\right)
$$

Therefore, the OLS estimator is biased and the term in bracket is the one minus the share of the variance of $x$ that is due to measurement error.Therefore
$\mid\hat{\beta}\mid < \beta$. This kind of bias is called an
**attenuation bias** (the absolute value of the estimator is lower
than the true value), which can be either a lower or an upper bias
depending on the sign of $\beta$.\index[general]{attenuation bias}\index[general]{bias!errors in variables}
This bias clearly doesn't attenuate in large samples. As $N$ grows, the
empirical variances/covariances converge to the population ones, and
the estimator therefore converges to: $\mbox{plim} \;\hat{\beta} = \beta \left(1 - \sigma_\nu ^ 2 / \sigma_x ^ 2\right)$. For example, if the measurement error accounts for 20% of the total
variance of $x$, $\hat{\beta}$ converges to 80% of the true parameter.
\index[general]{errors in variables|)}

### Ommited variable bias
\index[general]{ommited variable bias|(}
\index[general]{bias!ommited variable|(}

Suppose that the true model is: $y_n = \alpha + \beta_x x_n + \beta_z
z_n + \epsilon_n$, where the conditional expectation of $\epsilon$
with respect to $x$ and $z$ is 0. Therefore, this model could be
consistently estimated by least squares. Consider now that $z$ is
unobserved. Therefore, the model to be estimated is $y_n = \alpha +
\beta_x x_n + \eta_n$, with $\eta_n = \beta_z z_n + \epsilon_n$. The omission of
a relevant ($\beta_z \neq 0$) covariate has two consequences:

- the variance of the error is now $\sigma_\eta ^ 2 = \beta_z ^ 2
\sigma_z^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2$, and is therefore greater than the one
of the initial model for which $z$ is observed and used as a
covariate,
- the covariance between the error and $x$ is $\mbox{cov}(x, \eta) = \beta_z
  \mbox{cov}(x, z)$; therefore, if the covariate is correlated with the
  omitted variable, the covariate and the error of the model are
  correlated.

As the variance of the OLS estimator is proportional to the variance of
the errors, omission of a relevant covariate will always induce a less
precise estimation of the slopes and a lower R^2^. Moreover, if the omitted covariate is correlated with the covariate used in the
regression, the estimation will be biased and inconsistent. This
**omitted variable bias** can be computed as follow:

$$
\hat{\beta}_x = \beta_x + \frac{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x})(\beta_z z_n +
\epsilon_n)}{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x}) ^ 2}=
\beta_x + \beta_z \frac{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x}) (z_n - \bar{z})}{\sum_n
(x_n - \bar{x}) ^ 2} + 
\frac{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x}) \epsilon_n}{\sum_n (x_n - \bar{x}) ^ 2}
$$

Taking the conditional expectation, the last term disappears, so that:

$$
\mbox{E}(\hat{\beta}_x\mid x, z) = \beta_x + \beta_z
\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{xz}}{\hat{\sigma}_x ^ 2}
$$
There is an upper bias if the signs of the covariance between $x$ and
$z$ and $\beta_z$ are the same, and a lower bias if they have opposite
signs.
As $N$ tends to infinity, the OLS estimator converges to:

$$
\mbox{plim} \;\hat{\beta}_x = \beta_x + \beta_z \frac{\sigma_{xz}}{\sigma_x ^ 2}=
\beta_x + \beta_z \beta_{z / x}
$$

where $\beta_{z/x}$ is the true value of the slope of the regression
of $z$ on $x$. This formula makes clear what $\hat{\beta}_x$ really
estimates in a linear regression:

- the direct effect of $x$ on $y$ which is $\beta_x$,
- the indirect effect of $x$ on $y$ which is the product of the effect
  of $x$ on $z$ ($\beta_{z/x}$) times the effect of $z$ on $\eta$
  and therefore on $y$ ($\beta_z$).

A classic example of omitted variable bias occurs in the so-called Mincer
earning function which relates wage ($w$), education ($e$ in years) and experience
($s$ in weeks):

$$
\ln w = \beta_o + \beta_e e + \beta_s s + \beta_{ss} s ^ 2 + \epsilon
$$

$\beta_e = \frac{d\ln w}{de} = \frac{d w / w}{de}$ is the percentage
increase of the wage for one more year of education.  To illustrate
the estimation of a Mincer function, we use the data of
@KOOP:POIR:TOBI:05,\index[author]{Koop}\index[author]{Poirier}\index[author]{Tobias} which is a sample of 303 white males
taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and is available
as `sibling_educ`.
\idxdata[(]{sibling\_educ}{micsr.data}\idxfun{mutate}{dplyr}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{poly}{stats}

```{r }
#| label: mincer_sibling
sibling_educ <- sibling_educ %>%
    mutate(experience = experience / 52)
lm(log(wage) ~ educ + poly(experience, 2), sibling_educ) %>% gaze
```

Results indicate that one more year of education increases in average
the wage by 10%. One concern about this kind of estimation is that
individuals have different abilities ($a$), and that more ability have a
positive effect on wage, but may also have a positive effect on
education. If this is the case, $\beta_{a} > 0$, $\beta_{a/e} > 0$ and
therefore $\mbox{plim} \;\hat{\beta}_e = \beta_e + \beta_{a} \beta_{a/e} >
\beta_e$ and the OLS estimator is upward biased. This is the case
because more education:

- increases, for a given level of ability, the expected wage by
  $\beta_e$,
- means than, in average, the level of ability is higher, this effect
  being $\beta_{a/e}$ (which in this case doesn't imply a causality
  of $e$ on $a$, but simply a correlation), so that the wage will be
  also higher ($\beta_a > 0$).
  
Numerous studies of the Mincer function deal with this problem of
endogeneity of the education level. But in the data set we used, there
is a measure of the ability, which is the standardized AFQT test
score. If we introduce ability in the regression, education is no more
endogenous and least squares will give a consistent estimation of the
effect of education on wage.^[Needless to say, the hypothesis that abilities in all their dimensions can be measured by the AFQT test is very strong.] We first check that education and
ability are positively correlated:
\idxfun{summarise}{dplyr}\idxfun{cor}{stats}\idxfun{pull}{dplyr}

```{r }
#| collapse: true
#| label: corr_educ_ability
sibling_educ %>% summarise(cor(educ, ability)) %>% pull
```

Therefore, adding ability as a covariate in the previous regression should decrease the coefficient on
education:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{poly}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: mincer_ability
#| collapse: true
lm(log(wage) ~ educ + poly(experience, 2) + ability, sibling_educ) %>% 
  gaze(coef = "educ")
```

The effect of one more year of education is now an increase of 8.7% of the wage (compared to 10% previously).

### Simultaneity bias
\index[general]{simultaneity bias|(}
\index[general]{bias!simultaneity|(}
\index[general]{system estimation!simultaneity bias|(}

Often in economics, the phenomena of interest is not described by a
single equation, but by a system of equations. Consider for example a
market equilibrium. The two equations relate the quantity demanded /
supplied ($q ^ d$ and $q ^ o$) to the unit price and to some specific
covariates to the demand and to the supply side of the market. @MADD:LAHI:09\index[author]{Maddala}\index[author]{Lahiri}, pp.
376-377 studied the market for commercial loans using monthly US data
for 1979-1984. The data set is available as
`loan_market`. Total commercial loans (`loans`) are in billions
of dollars, the price is the average prime rate charged by banks
(`prime_rate`). `aaa_rate` is the AAA corporate bond rate, which is
the price of an alternative financing to firms. Therefore, it enters
the only demand equation, with an expected positive sign. `treas_rate`
is the treasure bill rate. As it is a substitute to commercial loans for
bank, it should enter only the supply equation, with an expected
negative sign. For the sake of simplicity, we denote $q$ and $p$ the quantity (in logarithm) and
the price for this loan market model and, respectively, $d$ and $s$
the two rates that enter only, respectively the demand and the supply
equation:
\idxdata[(]{loan\_market}{micsr.data}\idxfun{transmute}{dplyr}

```{r }
#| label: loan_market_covariates
loan <- loan_market %>%
    transmute(q = log(loans),  p = prime_rate,
              d = aaa_rate, s = treas_rate)
```

The equilibrium on the loan market is then defined by a system of
three equations:

  $$
\left\{
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    q_d &=& \alpha_d + \beta_d p + \gamma_d d + \epsilon_d \\
    q_s &=& \alpha_s + \beta_s p + \gamma_s s + \epsilon_s \\
    q_d &=& q_s
  \end{array}
\right.
  $$


The last equation is non-stochastic and states that the market should
be at the equilibrium. The demand curve should be decreasing ($\beta_d
< 0$) and the supply curve increasing ($\beta_s > 0$). The equilibrium is depicted on @fig-market_equilibrium.

```{r }
#| fig-cap: "Market equilibrium"
#| label: fig-market_equilibrium
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("./tikz/fig/equilibre.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

The OLS estimation of the demand and the supply equations are given below:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: supply_demand
#| collapse: true
ols_d <- lm(q ~ p + d, data = loan)
ols_s <- lm(q ~ p + s, data = loan)
ols_d %>% gaze
ols_s %>% gaze
```

The two coefficients of the demand equation have the predicted sign and are
highly significant: a one point of percentage increase of the prime
rate decreases loans by 4.3% and an increase of a one point of
percentage of the corporate bond rate increases loans by 10.3%. The
fit of the supply equation is very bad and, even if the two coefficients
have the predicted sign, the values are very low and insignificant. 

What is actually observed for each observation in the sample is a
price-quantity combination at an equilibrium. A positive shock on the
demand equation will move upward the demand curve and will leads
to a new equilibrium with a higher equilibrium quantity and also a
higher equilibrium price (except in the special case where the supply
curve is vertical, which means that the price elasticity of supply is infinite). This means that $p$ is correlated with $\epsilon_ d$,
which leads to a bias in the estimation of $\beta_d$ by OLS. The same
reasoning apply of course to the supply curve.

One solution would be to use the equilibrium condition and then to solve for $p$, and then for $q$. This **reduced-form** system of two equations:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{rcccccccccc}
p &=& \displaystyle \frac{\alpha_d - \alpha_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} &+&
\displaystyle \frac{\gamma_d}{\beta_s - \beta_d} d &-& 
\displaystyle \frac{\gamma_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} s &+& 
\displaystyle \frac{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} \\
&=& \pi_o &+& \pi_d d &+& \pi_s s &+& \nu_p \\
q &=& \displaystyle \frac{\alpha_d \beta_s - \beta_d \alpha_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} &+&
\displaystyle \frac{\beta_s \gamma_d}{\beta_s - \beta_d}d &-& 
\displaystyle \frac{\beta_d \gamma_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} s &+& 
\displaystyle \frac{- \beta_d \epsilon_s + \beta_s
\epsilon_d}{\beta_s - \beta_d} \\
&=&  \delta_o &+& \delta_d d &+& \delta_s s &+& \nu_q \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$
makes clear that both $p$ and $q$ depends on $\epsilon_s$ and
$\epsilon_d$. More precisely, as $\beta_s - \beta_d > 0$, $\epsilon_d$
and $\epsilon_s$ are respectively positively and negatively correlated
with the price. $\Delta \epsilon_d > 0$ will shift the demand curve
upward and therefore will increase the equilibrium price. Therefore,
the OLS estimator of the slope of the demand curve is biased upward which means, as it is
negative, that it biased downward in absolute value. A positive shock on the supply side
($\Delta \epsilon_s > 0$) will move the supply curve upward and therefore
will decrease the equilibrium price. The OLS estimator of the
slope of the supply curve is then downward biased.
The parameters of these two equations can be
consistently estimated by least squares, as $d$ and $s$ are
uncorrelated with the two error terms. 
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: reduced_form_market
#| collapse: true
ols_q <- lm(q ~ d + s, data = loan)
ols_p <- lm(p ~ d + s, data = loan)
ols_q %>% gaze
ols_p %>% gaze
```
The reduced form coefficients are not meaningful by themselves, but
only if they enable to retrieve the structural parameters. This is
actually the case here as
$\frac{\delta_s}{\pi_s}=\beta_d$ and
$\frac{\delta_d}{\pi_d}=\beta_s$.
\idxfun{unname}{base}

```{r }
#| label: retrieve_struct_par
#| collapse: true
price_coefs <- unname(coef(ols_q) / coef(ols_p))[2:3]
price_coefs
```

The price coefficients are as expected higher in absolute values than
those obtained using OLS on the demand and on the supply
equation. It is particularly the case for $\beta_s$ 
(`r round(price_coefs[1], 3)` vs `r round(coef(ols_s)["p"], 3)`) 
On the contrary, the absolute value of $\beta_d$ increases very slightly 
(`r round(price_coefs[2], 3)` vs `r round(coef(ols_d)["p"], 3)`).
\idxdata[)]{loan\_market}{micsr.data}

Actually, the case we have considered is special because there is one
and only one extra covariate in both equations. Consider as an example
the following system of equations:

$$
\left\{
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    y_d &=& \alpha_d + \beta_d p + \gamma_1 d_1 + \gamma_2 d_2 + \epsilon_d \\
    y_s &=& \alpha_s + \beta_s p + \epsilon_s \\
    y_d &=& y_s
  \end{array}
\right.
$$

where there are two extra covariates in the demand equation and no
covariates (except the price) in the supply equation. Solving for the
two endogenous variables $p$ and $q$, we get in this case:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{rcccccccccc}
p &=& \displaystyle \frac{\alpha_d - \alpha_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} &+&
\displaystyle\frac{\gamma_1}{\beta_s - \beta_d} d_1 &+& 
\displaystyle \frac{\gamma_2}{\beta_s - \beta_d} d_2 &+& 
\displaystyle \frac{\epsilon_d - \epsilon_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} \\
&=& \pi_s &+& \pi_1 d_1 &+& \pi_2 d_2 &+& \nu_p \\
q &=& \displaystyle \frac{\beta_s \alpha_d - \beta_d \alpha_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} &+&
\displaystyle \frac{\beta_s \gamma_1}{\beta_s - \beta d}d_1 &+& 
\displaystyle \frac{\beta_s \gamma_2}{\beta_s - \beta_d} d_2 &+& 
\displaystyle \frac{\beta_s \epsilon_d - \beta_d \epsilon_s}{\beta_s - \beta_d} \\
&=& \delta_s &+& \delta_1 d_1 &+& \delta_2 d_2 &+& \nu_q \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$

we no have $\frac{\delta_1}{\pi_1} = \frac{\delta_2}{\pi_2} =
\beta_s$; there are two ratios of the reduced parameters that give the
value of the slope of the supply curve, but it is very implausible that these two values are equal. On the contrary, there is no way to
retrieve the slope of the demand curve from the reduced form
parameters. Therefore, this **indirect least squares** \index[general]{indirect least squares}
approach is of
limited interest. In the general case, as we have seen, some
coefficients like $\beta_s$ in our example may be **over-identified**
and some other like $\beta_d$ are **under-identified**.\index[general]{identification}

## The simple instrumental variable estimator {#sec-simple_iv}

The general idea of the **instrumental variable** estimator (**IV** in short) is to find
variables which are correlated with the endogenous covariates and
uncorrelated with the error of the structural equation. This
means that the instruments don't have a direct effect on the response,
but only an indirect effect because of their correlation with the
endogenous covariates. These instruments allow to get an exogenous
source of variation of the covariate, ie a source of variation that
has nothing to do with the process of interest. 
We'll start with the simple case where the number of
instruments equals the number of endogenous covariates, ie the **just-identified** case.

### Computation of the simple instrumental variable estimator

\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!just identified|(}
Consider a simple linear regression: $y_n = \alpha + \beta  x_n + \epsilon_n$, with $\mbox{E}(\epsilon \mid x) \neq 0$. From @eq-normal_equation, the first order conditions for the minimization of the sum of square residuals can be written as:

$$
\frac{1}{N} \sum_n \left[ (y_n - \bar{y}) - \hat{\beta} (x_n - \bar{x})\right]
(x_n - \bar{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_n \hat{\epsilon}_n (x_n - \bar{x}) =
\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\epsilon} x}= 0
$$ {\#eq-normal_eq2}

@eq-normal_eq2 states that the OLS estimator is obtained by imposing
the sample equivalent to the moment condition $\mbox{E}(\epsilon \mid
x) = 0$, ie that the covariance between the residuals and the
covariate is exactly 0 in the sample. This of course leads to a biased
and inconsistent estimator if $\mbox{E}(\epsilon \mid x)\neq 0$. Now
suppose that a variable $w$ exists, which is correlated with the
covariate, but not with the error of the model (this latter hypothesis is called the **exclusion restriction**\index[general]{exclusion restriction}. Such a variable has 
no direct effect on the response, but only an indirect effect due to
its correlation with the covariate. Stated differently, this variable
provides an exogenous source of variation of the covariate. As by
hypothesis, $\mbox{E}(\epsilon \mid w) = 0$, a consistent estimator
can be obtained by imposing the sample equivalent to this moment
condition, ie by setting the estimator to a value such that the
covariance between the residuals and the instrument is 0:

$$
\frac{1}{N} \sum_n \left[ (y_n - \bar{y}) - \hat{\beta} (x_n - \bar{x})\right]
(w_n - \bar{w}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_n \hat{\epsilon}_n (w_n - \bar{w}) =
\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\epsilon} w}= 0
$$ {\#eq-normal_inst_eq}

Solving @eq-normal_inst_eq for $\hat{\beta}$, we get the
instrumental variable estimator:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(y_n - \bar{y})}{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(x_n - \bar{x})} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{wy}}{\hat{\sigma}_{wx}}
$$ {\#eq-iv_simple}

which is ratio of the empirical covariances of $w$ with $y$ and with
$x$. Dividing both sides of the ratio by the empirical variance of $w$
($\hat{\sigma}_w ^ 2$), @eq-iv_simple can also be written as:


$$
\hat{\beta}  = \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{wy} / \hat{\sigma}_w ^
2}{\hat{\sigma}_{wx} / \hat{\sigma}_w ^2} 
= \frac{\hat{\beta}_{y/w}}{\hat{\beta}_{x/w}} = \frac{dy /
dw}{dx / dw}
$$ {#eq-iv_ratio_me}

where $\hat{\beta}_{y/w}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{x/w}$ are the slopes of the regressions of $y$ and $x$ on $w$. Therefore, the IV estimator is also the ratio of the marginal effects of $w$ on $y$ and on $x$.^[See @HECK:00\index[author]{Heckman}, page 58 and @CAME:TRIV:05\index[author]{Cameron}\index[author]{Trivedi}, page 98.]
Replacing $y_n - \bar{y}$ by $\beta(x_n - \bar{x}) + \epsilon_n$ in
@eq-iv_simple, we get:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \beta + \frac{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w}) \epsilon}{\sum_n
(w_n - \bar{w}) (x_n - \bar{x})} = \beta +
\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{w\epsilon}}{\hat{\sigma}_{wx}}
$$

As $N$ grows, the two empirical covariances converge to the population
covariances and, as by hypothesis, the instrument is uncorrelated with
the error ($\sigma_{w\epsilon} = 0$) and is correlated with the
covariate ($\sigma_{wx} \neq0$), the instrumental variable
estimator is consistent ($\mbox{plim} \;\hat{\beta} = \beta + \frac{\sigma_{w\epsilon}}{\sigma_{wx}} = \beta$).
Assuming spherical disturbances, the variance of the IV estimator
is:

$$
\mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}) = \mbox{E}\left[(\hat{\beta}-\beta)^2\right] = 
\frac{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2 \sum_n (w_n - \bar{w}) ^ 2}{\left[\sum_n
(w_n - \bar{w})(x_n - \bar{x})\right] ^ 2} = \frac{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2
\hat{\sigma}_w ^ 2}{N \hat{\sigma}_{wx} ^ 2}
= \frac{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2}{N \hat{\sigma}_x ^ 2 \hat{\rho}_{wx} ^ 2}
=\left(\frac{\sigma_\epsilon}{\sqrt{N} \hat{\sigma}_x \mid \hat{\rho}_{wx}\mid}\right) ^ 2
$$

The last expression, which introduces the coefficient of correlation
between $x$ and $z$ is particularly appealing as it shows that,
compared to the standard error of the OLS estimator, the standard error of the IV estimator is inflated by $1 / \mid \hat{\rho}_{wx}\mid$. This term
is close to 1 if the correlation between $x$ and $w$ is high, in this
case, the loss of precision implied by the use of the IV estimator
is low. On the contrary, if the correlation between $x$ and $w$ is
low, the IV estimator will be very imprecisely estimated.

\index[general]{two-stage least squares estimator|(}
\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!two-stage least squares|(}

The IV estimator can also be obtained by first regressing $x$ on
$w$ and then by regressing $y$ on the fitted values of the previous
regression. Consider the linear model that relates the instrument to the covariate: $x_n = \gamma + \delta w_n + \nu_n$. We estimate this model by OLS and then we can express the fitted values ($\hat{x}$) as a function of $\hat{\delta}$: $\hat{x}_n - \bar{x} = \hat{\delta}(w_n - \bar{w})$.
We can therefore rewrite the numerator and the
denominator of the IV estimator given by @eq-iv_simple as:

- $\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(y_n - \bar{y}) = \sum_n (\hat{x}_n - \bar{x}) (y_n - \bar{y})/ \hat{\delta}$,
- $\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(x_n - \bar{x})  = \sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(\hat{x}_n + \hat{\epsilon}_n- \bar{x}) = \sum_n (\hat{x}_n -\bar{x}) ^ 2/ \hat{\gamma}$ (as $\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})
\hat{\epsilon}_n=0$), 

so that:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_n(\hat{x}_n - \bar{x})(y_n -
\bar{y})}{\sum_n(\hat{x}_n - \bar{x}) ^ 2}
$$

which is the OLS estimator of $y$ on $\hat{x}$, $\hat{x}$ being
the fitted values of the regression of $x$ on $w$. Therefore, the
IV estimator can be obtained by running two OLS regressions
and is for this reason also called the **two-stage least square**
estimator (or **2SLS** in short). As $x$ is correlated with $\epsilon$,
but wz is not, the idea of the 2SLS estimator is to replace $x$
by a linear transformation of $w$ which is as close as possible to
$x$ and this is simply the fitted values of the regression of $x$ on
$w$.

\index[general]{two-stage least squares estimator|)}
\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!two-stage least squares|)}

The extension of the case when there are $K > 1$ covariates and $K$
instruments is straightforward. The two sets of variables $x$ and $w$
can overlap because, if some of the covariates are exogenous, they
should also be used as instruments. Denoting $w$ the vector of instruments, the moment conditions are
$\mbox{E}(\epsilon \mid w) = 0$ and the sample equivalent is:

$$
\frac{1}{N} W ^ \top (y - Z \gamma) = 0
$$

with $Z$ and $W$ are $N\times (K+1)$ matrix containing respectively the covariates and the instruments (with a vector of 1). Solving for $\gamma$, we get the instrumental variable estimator:

$$
\hat{\gamma} = (W^\top X) ^ {-1} W^\top y
$$

### Small sample properties of the **IV** estimator {#sec-ssprop_iv}

\index[general]{small sample properties!instrumental variable estimator|(}
\index[general]{bias!instrumental variable estimator|(}
Although it is consistent, the instrumental variable estimator isn't
unbiased. Actually, it doesn't even have an expected value in the just
identified case. This result can be easily shown starting with the
following system of equation:^[See @DAVI:MACK:04\index[author]{Davidson}\index[author]{McKinnon}, pages 326-327.]

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
y &=& \alpha + \beta x + \sigma_\epsilon \epsilon\\
x &=& \gamma + \delta w + \sigma_\nu \nu\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$

where for convenience, the two errors terms are written as standard
normal deviates. Moreover, we can write $\epsilon = \rho \nu + \iota$,
so that $\rho$ is the coefficient of correlation between the two error
terms and $\iota$ is by construction uncorrelated with $\nu$. The IV
estimator is then:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(y_n - \bar{y})}
{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(x_n - \bar{x})} = \beta + \frac{\sigma_{\epsilon}\sum_n (w_n -
\bar{w})(\rho \nu_n + \iota_n)}{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(x_n - \bar{x})}
$$ {#eq-simpleiv_bias1}

The denominator is closely linked to the OLS estimator of $\gamma$,
which is:

$$
\hat{\delta} = \frac{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})(x_n - \bar{x})}{\sum_n
(w_n - \bar{w}) ^ 2} = \delta + 
\frac{\sigma_\nu\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})\nu_n}{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w}) ^ 2}
$$ {#eq-simpleiv_bias2}

From @eq-simpleiv_bias1 and @eq-simpleiv_bias2, we get:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \beta + \frac{\sigma_\epsilon \rho \sum_n (w_n - \bar{w})\nu_n +
\sigma_\epsilon \sum_n (w_n - \bar{w}) \iota_n}
{\gamma \sum_n(w_n - \bar{w}) ^ 2 + \sigma_\nu\sum_n(w_n - \bar{w}) \nu_n}
$$

Denoting $c_n = \frac{w_n - \bar{w}}{\sqrt{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w}) ^
2}}$, with $\sum_n c_n ^ 2 = 1$, we get:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \beta + \frac{\sigma_\epsilon \rho \sum_n c_n\nu_n +
\sigma_\epsilon \sum_n c_n\iota_n}
{\gamma \sqrt{\sum_n(w_n - \bar{w}) ^ 2} + \sigma_\nu\sum_n c_n \nu_n}
$$

As, by construction, $\mbox{E}(\iota \mid \nu) = 0$, denoting $\omega =
\sum_n c_n \nu_n$, which is a standard normal deviate and $a = \delta \sqrt{\sum_n (w_n - \bar{w}) ^ 2} / \sigma_\nu$ we finally get:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \beta + \frac{\sigma_\epsilon
\rho}{\sigma_\nu}\frac{\omega}{\omega + a}
$$
Then the expected value of $\hat{\beta}$ is obtained by integrating
out this expression with respect to $\omega$:

$$
\mbox{E}(\hat{\beta}) = \beta  + \frac{\sigma_\epsilon
\rho}{\sigma_\nu}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\omega}{\omega + a}\phi(\omega)d\omega
$$

but this integral is divergent as $\omega / (a + \omega)$ tends to
infinity as $\omega$ approach  $-a$. Therefore, $\hat{\beta}$ has no expected value. The 2SLS derivation of the IV estimator also gives an intuition of the reason why the IV estimator is not unbiased. It would be if, for the second OLS
estimation, $\mbox{E}(x_n\mid w_n) = \gamma + \delta w_n$ were used as the
regressor. But actually, $\hat{x}_n = \hat{\gamma} + \hat{\delta} w_n$
is used and, as the OLS estimator over-fits, the fitted values of $x$ will be
partly correlated with $\epsilon$. Of course, when the sample size
grows, as the OLS estimator is consistent, $\hat{x}_n$ converges to
$\gamma + \delta z_n$ and the asymptotic bias vanishes.
This can be usefully illustrated by simulation. The 
`iv_data` function draws a sample of $y$, $x$ and one instrument $w$:
\idxfun{names}{base}\idxfun{matrix}{base}\idxfun{rnorm}{stats}\idxfun{chol}{base}\idxfun{colnames}{base}\idxfun{as\_tibble}{tibble}\idxfun{add\_column}{tibble}\idxfun{factor}{base}\idxfun{mutate}{dplyr}\idxfun{matrix}{base}


```{r }

    names(sds) <- nms ;  names(mns) <- c("x", "w")
    b_wx <- r_xw * sds["x"] / sds["w"]
    a_wx <- mns["x"] - b_wx * mns["w"]
    cors <- matrix(c(1, r_xe, r_xw, r_xe, 1, r_we, r_xw, 0, 1), nrow = 3)
    XEW <- matrix(rnorm(N * R * 3), nrow = N * R) %*%
        chol(cors) 
    colnames(XEW) <- nms
    XEW %>%
        as_tibble %>%
        mutate(x = x * sds["x"] + mns["x"],
               w = w * sds["w"] + mns["w"],
               e = e * sds["e"],
               Exw = a_wx + b_wx * w,
               y = alpha + beta * x + e) %>%
        add_column(id = factor(rep(1:R, each = N)), .before = 1)
}
```

The argument of the function are sample size (`N`), the number of samples (`R`),
the correlations between
$x$ and $\epsilon$ (the default is 0.5), between $x$ and $w$ (0.2 by
default) and between $w$ and $\epsilon$. The default value for
this last correlation is 0, which is a necessary condition for the IV
estimator to be consistent. $x$, $\epsilon$ and $w$ are assumed by
default to be standard normal deviates, but the means of $x$ and $w$
and the standard deviations of $x$, $w$ and $\epsilon$ can be
customized using the `mns` and `sds` argument. Finally, the
coefficients of the linear relation between $y$ and $x$ are `alpha`
and `beta` and these two values are set by default to 1. First, a
matrix of normal standard deviates `XEW` is constructed. This matrix
is post-multiplied by the Cholesky decomposition of the matrix of
correlation, which introduces the desired correlation between $x$,
$\epsilon$ and $w$. $x$, $\epsilon$ and $w$ are then adjusted for
non-zero means and non-unity standard deviations if necessary. Finally the vector
of response is computed, along with the conditional expectation of $x$: $\mbox{E}(x\mid w) = \gamma + \delta w$. The `iv_coefs` function computes the IV estimator using the
2SLS approach.
\idxfun{lm.fit}{stats}\idxfun{coef}{stats}\idxfun{unname}{base}\idxfun{tibble}{tibble}

```{r }
#| label: iv_coefs
iv_coefs <- function(i){
    xh <- lm.fit(cbind(1, i$w), i$x)$fitted.values
    ols <- coef(lm.fit(cbind(1, i$x), i$y))[2] %>% unname
    ivo <- coef(lm.fit(cbind(1, i$Exw), i$y))[2] %>% unname
    iv <- coef(lm.fit(cbind(1, xh), i$y))[2] %>% unname
    tibble(ols = ols, ivo = ivo, iv = iv)
}
```

It uses `lm.fit` to regress $x$ on $w$.^[`lm.fit` is used internally by `lm` and its two first arguments are a matrix of covariates and the response.] We compute `xh` which is
$\hat{x} = \hat{\gamma} + \hat{\delta}  w_n$, the fitted values
of the regression of $x$ on $w$. `iv_coefs` computes three estimators:

- `ols`, which is the OLS estimator of $y$ on $x$,
- `iv`, which is the 2SLS estimator of $y$ on $x$ using $w$ as
  instruments,
- `ivo`, which is an estimator that can only be computed in the context of simulations and
  uses $\mbox{E}(x_n\mid w_n)$ instead of $\hat{x}_n$ as the regressor in
  the second OLS estimation.
  
We first generate a unique sample of 100 observations and we compute the three estimators.
\idxfun{set.seed}{base}

```{r }
#| label: iv_data_one_sample
#| collapse: true
set.seed(1)
d <- iv_data(R = 1, N = 1E02)
iv_coefs(d)
```

To empirically analyze the distribution of these three estimators, we then
generate several samples by setting the `R` argument, 
compute the estimators for every sample and analyze the empirical
distribution of the estimators. This can be easily done using
`tidyr::nests` and `tidyr::unnests`, as in @sec-random_numbers_simulations. 
\idxfun{set.seed}{base}\idxfun{nest}{tidyr}\idxfun{transmute}{dplyr}\idxfun{unnest}{tidyr}\idxfun{map}{purrr}\idxfun{print}{base}

```{r }
#| label: simul_nest_unnest
#| cache: true
set.seed(1)
d <- iv_data(R = 1E04, N = 50) %>%
    nest(.by = id) %>%
    transmute(model = map(data, iv_coefs)) %>%
    unnest(cols = model)
d %>% print(n = 3)
```

We then compute the mean and the standard deviation for the three
estimators:
\idxfun{summarise}{dplyr}\idxfun{everything}{dplyr}\idxfun{list}{base}\idxfun{pivot\_longer}{tidyr}\idxfun{separate}{tidyr}\idxfun{pivot\_wider}{tidyr}

```{r }
#| label: dist_iv_estimator
d %>% summarise(across(everything(),
                       list(mean = mean, sd = sd))) %>%
    pivot_longer(1:6) %>%
    separate(name, into = c("model", "stat")) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = stat, values_from = value)
```

The distribution of the three estimators is presented in @fig-dist_iv.
\idxfun{as\_tibble}{tibble}\idxfun{pivot\_longer}{tidyr}\idxfun{ggplot}{ggplot2}\idxfun{aes}{ggplot2}\idxfun{geom\_density}{ggplot2}\idxfun{scale\_x\_continuous}{ggplot2}

```{r }
#| message: false

#| label: fig-dist_iv
dsties <- d %>% as_tibble %>% pivot_longer(1:3) %>% ggplot(aes(value)) +
    geom_density(aes(linetype = name)) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 3))
dsties
```

The OLS estimator is severely biased as the central value of its
distribution is about 1.5 and it has a small variance. The "pseudo"
IV estimator seems unbiased as its mean (and median) is very close
to one. The standard deviation is about 10 times larger than the one
of the OLS estimator, so that the density is extremely flat.  The
mode of the density curve of the IV estimator is slightly larger
than one. Moreover, it has extremely fat tails (much more than the
ones of the pseudo IV estimator), which explain why the expected
value and the variance don't exist. This feature becomes obvious if we
zoom on extreme values of the estimator, for example on the $(-4,-3)$
range (see @fig-dist_iv_zoom).

### An example

\idxdata[(]{tracks\_side}{micsr.data}
@ANAN:11\index[author]{Ananat} investigates the causal effect of segregation on urban poverty
and inequality. Several responses are used, especially the Gini index and 
the poverty rate for the black populations of 121 American cities. The
data set is called `tracks_side`. The level of segregation is
measured by the following dissimilarity index:

$$
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1} ^ N \left| b_n - w_n \right|
$$

where $b_n$ and $w_n$ are respectively the share of the black and of the white
population of the whole city that lives in census track $n$ of the
city. This index range from 0 (no segregation) to 1 (perfect
segregation). In the sample of 121 cities used, the segregation index ranges
from `r round(min(tracks_side$segregation), 2)` to 
`r round(max(tracks_side$segregation), 2)`, 
with a median value of `r round(median(tracks_side$segregation), 2)`.
We'll focus on the effect of segregation on the poverty rate of black
people:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: ols_tracks_side
#| collapse: true
lm_yx <- lm(povb ~ segregation, tracks_side)
lm_yx %>% gaze
```

The coefficient of segregation is positive and highly significant. It
indicates that a one point increase of the segregation index rises the
poverty rate of black people by about `r round(coef(lm_yx)[2], 2)` point. 
The correlation between segregation and bad economic outcome for black people is well
established but, according to the author, the OLS estimator cannot easily be
considered as a measure of the causal relationship of segregation on
income as there are some other variables that both influence
segregation and outcome for the black people. As an example, she
describes the situation of Detroit, which is a highly segregated city
with poor economic outcomes, but other characteristics of the city
(political corruption, legacy of a manufacturing economy) can be the
cause of these two phenomena [@ANAN:11 p. 35]\index[author]{Ananat}.
Therefore, the OLS estimator is suspected to be biased and
inconsistent because of the omitted variable bias. The instrumental
variable estimator can be used in this context, but it requires the
use of a good instrumental variable, ie a variable which is correlated
with the endogenous covariate (segregation), but not directly with the
response (the poverty rate). The author suggests that the way cities
were subdivided by railroads into a large number of neighborhoods can
be used as an instrument. Moreover, the tracks were mostly built
during the nineteenth century, prior the great migration (between 1915
to 1950) were a lot of Afro-Americans migrated from the south. More
precisely, the index is defined as follow:

$$
1 - \sum_n \left(\frac{a_n}{A}\right) ^ 2
$$

where $a_n$ is the area of the neighborhood $n$ defined by the rail
tracks and $A$ is the total area of the city. The index is 0 if the
city is completely undivided and tends to 1 if the number of
neighborhoods tends to infinity. This index 
ranges from `r round(min(tracks_side$raildiv), 2)` to 
`r round(max(tracks_side$raildiv), 2)`, 
with a median value of `r round(median(tracks_side$raildiv), 2)`.
The regression of $x$ (`segregation`) on $w$ (`raildiv`) gives:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: first_step_tracks_side
#| collapse: true
lm_xw <- lm(segregation ~ raildiv, tracks_side)
lm_xw %>% gaze
```

In the 2SLS interpretation of the IV estimator, this is the
first-stage regression. The coefficient of `raildiv` is as expected
positive and is highly significant. It is important to check that the
correlation between the covariate and the instrument is strong enough
to get a precise IV estimator. This can be performed by computing
their coefficient of correlation, or using the R^2^ or the $F$
statistic of the first stage regression:
\idxfun{summarise}{dplyr}\idxfun{cor}{stats}\idxfun{pull}{dplyr}\idxfun{ftest}{micsr}\idxfun{rsq}{micsr}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: cor_segr_rail
#| collapse: true
tracks_side %>% summarise(cor(segregation, raildiv)) %>% pull
lm_xw %>% ftest %>% gaze
lm_xw %>% rsq
```

The IV estimator can be obtained by regressing the response on the
fitted values of the first stage regression:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: second_step_tracks_side
#| collapse: true
lm_yhx <- lm(povb ~ fitted(lm_xw), tracks_side)
lm_yhx %>% gaze
```
As expected, the IV estimator is larger than the OLS estimator (`r round(coef(lm_yhx)[2], 2)` vs `r round(coef(lm_yx)[2], 2)`).
It can also be obtained by dividing the
OLS coefficients of the regressions of $y$ on $w$ and of $x$ on
$w$. The latter has already been computed, the former is:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{coef}{stats}

```{r }
#| collapse: true
#| label: iv_ratio_margeffects
lm_yw <- lm(povb ~ raildiv, tracks_side)
coef(lm_yw)[2]
coef(lm_yw)[2] / coef(lm_xw)[2]
```

A one point increase of `raildiv` is associated with a
`r round(coef(lm_xw)[2], 2)` point of the discrimination index and
with a `r round(coef(lm_yw)[2], 2)` point of the poverty
rate. Therefore, the 
`r round(coef(lm_xw)[2], 2)` increase of `segregation` 
increases `povb` by `r round(coef(lm_yw)[2], 2)`, which means that an
increase of 1 point  of `segregation` would increase `povb` by 
$`r round(coef(lm_yw)[2], 2)` / `r round(coef(lm_xw)[2], 2)` = 
`r round(coef(lm_yw)[2] / coef(lm_xw)[2], 2)`$, which is the value of
the IV estimator.

### Wald estimator {#sec-wald_estimator}

\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!Wald estimator|(}
\index[general]{Wald estimator|(}

The Wald estimator is the special case of the instrumental variable
estimator where the instrument $w$ is a binary variable and therefore
defines two groups ($w=0$ and $w=1$). In this case, the slope of the regression
of $y$ on $z$ is $\hat{\beta}_{y/w} = \bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_0$, where
$\bar{y}_i$ is the sample mean of $y$ in group $i=0,1$, and similarly,
the regression of $x$ on $w$ is $\hat{\beta}_{x/w} = \bar{x}_1 -
\bar{x}_0$. The Wald estimator is then:

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_0}{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_0} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{yw}}{\hat{\beta}_{xw}}
$$

As $(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_0)$ converges to a constant, the asymptotic
standard deviation of $\hat{\beta}$ is:^[see @ANGR:90\index[author]{Angrist}, note 7, p. 321-322.]

$$
\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\beta}} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_0}}{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_0}
$$ {\#eq-std_wald}

@ANGR:90\index[author]{Angrist} studied whether veterans (in his article of the Vietnam war)
experience a long-term loss of income, and therefore should legitimately
receive a benefit to compensate this loss. An obvious way to detect a
loss would be to consider a sample with two groups (veterans and
non-veterans) and to compare the mean income in these two
groups. However, enrollment in the army is not random and therefore, it
is probable that "certain types of men are more likely to serve in the
armed force than others".^[@ANGR:90\index[author]{Angrist}, p. 313.] In this situation,
income difference is likely to be a biased estimator of the military
enrollment. To overcome this difficulty, @ANGR:90\index[author]{Angrist} used the fact that a
draft lottery was used during the Vietnam war to select the young men
who were enrolled in the army. More precisely, the 365 possible days
of birth were randomly drawn and ordered and, latter on, the army
announced the number of days of birth that would lead to an
enrollment (depending on the year, this number was between 95 and
195). All the lottery eligible men didn't go to the war and some that
were not eligible fought, but the lottery produces an exogenous
variation of the probability to be enrolled.
<!-- - the 1970 lottery concerns men borned from 1944 to 1950 and the -->

\idxdata[(]{vietnam}{micsr.data}
Two data sources are used and contained in the `vietnam` data set. The first one is a 1% sample of all the

every combination of birth year (`birth`, from 1950 to 1953), draft
eligibility (`eligible` a factor with levels `yes` or `no`), race
(`white` or `nonwhite`) and year (from 1966 to 1984 for men born in
1950 and starting in 1967, 1968 and 1969 for men born respectively

The results match table 1 of @ANGR:90\index[author]{Angrist} page 318 (except that, in his
table, the income is not divided by the cpi).
The mean income difference is the numerator of the Wald
estimator. The denominator is the difference of enrollment probability
between draft eligible and ineligible young men. The author estimates
this difference using the data of the 1984 Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP), which are available in the subset of the
`vietnam` data set obtained with `variable == "veteran"` and contains the
share of veterans and the standard deviation of this share
for eligible and non-eligible young men by year of
birth and race (`birth` and `race`):
\idxfun{filter}{dplyr}\idxfun{select}{dplyr}

```{r }
#| label: veterans
veterans <- vietnam %>%
    filter(variable == "veteran") %>%
    select(- year, - cpi, - variable)
veterans %>% print(n = 3)
```

We then create one column for eligible and non-eligible young men and
we compute the difference of shares of enrollment and its standard
deviation:
\idxfun{pivot\_wider}{tidyr}\idxfun{mutate}{dplyr}\idxfun{select}{dplyr}

```{r }
#| label: dshare_elig
dshare_elig <- veterans %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = eligible, values_from = c(mean, sd)) %>%
    mutate(dshare = mean_yes - mean_no, 
           sd_dshare = sqrt(sd_yes ^ 2 + sd_no ^ 2)) %>%
    select(- (mean_no:sd_total))
dshare_elig %>% print(n = 2)
```

Finally, we join the two tables by race and year of birth, we
compute the Wald estimator of the income difference, its standard
deviation (using @eq-std_wald) and the student statistic, which is
their ratio:
\idxfun{left\_join}{dplyr}\idxfun{mutate}{dplyr}\idxfun{select}{dplyr}

```{r }
#| label: wald_estimator
wald <- dinc_elig %>%
    left_join(dshare_elig, by = c("birth", "race")) %>%
    mutate(wald = dmean / dshare,
           sd = sd_dmean / dshare,
           z = wald / sd) %>%
    select(birth, race, year, wald, sd, z)
wald %>% print(n = 2)
```

The income differentials are depicted in @fig-veterans; note the use of `geom_ribbon` to draw a confidence interval for the mean income difference.
\idxfun{filter}{dplyr}\idxfun{aes}{ggplot2}\idxfun{geom\_ribbon}{ggplot2}\idxfun{geom\_hline}{ggplot2}\idxfun{geom\_smooth}{ggplot2}\idxfun{facet\_grid}{ggplot2}

```{r }
#| label: fig-veterans
#| fig-cap: Income differentials between veterans and non-veterans
#| warning: false
wald %>%
    filter(race == "white") %>%
    ggplot(aes(year, wald)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = wald - 1.96 * sd, ymax = wald + 1.96 * sd), 
                fill = "lightgrey") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 0.2, color = "black") +
    facet_grid(~ birth)
```

The income differential between veterans and non-veterans is substantial and persistent (about one thousand US $ of 1984) and is most of the time significant at the 5% level (except for men born in 1951).\idxdata[)]{vietnam}{micsr.data}

## The general IV estimator {#sec-general_iv}

\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!general|(}
Consider now the general case. Among the covariates, some of them are
endogenous and other not and should be included in the instrument
list. Moreover, there may be more instruments than endogenous covariates.

### Computation of the estimator

There are $K$ covariates, $J$ endogenous covariates, $K-J$ exogenous covariates and $G$ external instruments.
We denote $Z$ and $W$ the matrix of covariates and instruments. The
number of columns of these two matrices are respectively $K + 1$ and
$G + K - J + 1$. For the model to be identified, we must have $G + K -
J + 1 \geq K + 1$ or $G \geq J$. Therefore, there must be at least as
many external instruments than there are endogenous covariates. We'll now
denote $L + 1= G + K - J + 1$ the number of columns of $W$. The $L+1$ moment
conditions are $\mbox{E}(\epsilon | w) = 0$ which implies
$\mbox{E}(\epsilon w) = 0$. The sample
equivalent is the vector of $L + 1$ empirical moments:
$m = \frac{1}{N}W^\top \hat{\epsilon}$. As $\hat{\epsilon} = y - Z
\hat{\gamma}$, this is a system of $L + 1$ equation with $K + 1$
unknown parameter. The system is over-identified if $L > K$ and in
this case it is not possible to find a vector of estimates
$\hat{\beta}$ for which all the empirical moments are 0. The
instrumental variable estimator in this setting is the vector of
parameters that makes the vector of empirical moments as close as
possible to a vector of 0. If the errors are spherical, the variance of the vector of empirical
moments is:

$$
\mbox{V}(m) = \mbox{V}\left(\frac{1}{N}W^\top \epsilon\right)= 
\frac{1}{N ^ 2} \mbox{E}\left(W^\top \epsilon \epsilon ^ \top
W\right)=
\frac{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2}{N ^ 2}W^\top W
$$ {\#eq-var_homosc}

and the IV estimator minimizes the quadratic form of the vector of
moments with the inverse of its covariance matrix:

$$
\frac{N ^ 2}{\sigma_\epsilon^2}m^\top (W ^\top W) ^ {-1} m
=\frac{1}{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2} \epsilon^\top W (W ^\top W) ^{-1} W ^
\top \epsilon
=\frac{1}{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2} \epsilon^\top P_W \epsilon
$$

where $P_W$ is the projection matrix of $W$, ie $P_Wz$
is the vector of fitted values of $z$ obtained by regressing $z$ on
$W$. Therefore, the IV estimator minimizes:

$$
\frac{1}{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2} (y - Z\gamma)^\top P_W (y - Z\gamma) =
\frac{1}{\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2} (P_W y - P_W Z\gamma)^\top(P_Wy - P_WZ\gamma)
$$

and therefore (because $P_W$ is idempotent):

$$
\hat{\beta} = (Z^\top P_W Z) ^ {-1} (Z^\top P_W y)
$$ {\#eq-overidentified_iv}

The 2SLS interpretation of the IV estimator is clear as it is
the OLS estimator of a model with $y$ or ($P_W y$) as the response and
$P_W Z$ the covariate. Therefore, it can be obtained by regressing in
a first step all the covariates on the instruments and in a second
steps by regressing the response on the fitted values of all the
covariates obtained in the first step.
Replacing $y$ by $Z\gamma + \epsilon$ in @eq-overidentified_iv, we get:

$$
\hat{\gamma} = \gamma + \left(\frac{1}{N}Z^\top P_W Z\right) ^ {-1} \left(\frac{1}{N}Z^\top P_W \epsilon\right)
$$

and the IV estimator is consistent if $\mbox{plim} \frac{1}{N}
Z^\top P_W\epsilon = 0$, or $\mbox{plim} \frac{1}N W ^ \top \epsilon = 0$. With spherical disturbances, the variance of the IV estimator is:

$$
\mbox{V}(\hat{\gamma}) = \left(\frac{1}{N}Z^\top P_WZ\right) ^ {-1}
\left(\frac{1}{N ^ 2}Z^\top P_W \epsilon \epsilon ^ \top P_W Z\right)  
\left(\frac{1}{N}Z^\top P_W Z\right) ^ {-1} =
\sigma_\epsilon ^ 2\left(Z^\top P_W Z\right) ^ {-1}
$$
\index[general]{general method of moments estimator|(}
\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!general method of moments estimator|(}
\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!two stage|(}

If the errors are heteroskedastic (or correlated), @eq-var_homosc is a
biased estimator of the variance of the moments, as
$\mbox{E}(\epsilon\epsilon^\top) \neq \sigma_\epsilon ^ 2 I$. In
case of heteroscedasticity, $\mbox{E}(W^\top\epsilon\epsilon^\top W)$ can be consistently
estimated by $\hat{S} = \sum_n \hat{\epsilon}_n ^ 2 w_n w_n^\top$
where $\hat{\epsilon}$ are the residuals of a consistent estimation,
for example the residuals of the IV estimator previously
described. Then, the objective function is:

$$
(y - Z\gamma)^\top W \hat{S}^{-1} W^\top (y - Z\gamma)
$$

Minimizing this quadratic form leads to the **general method of moments** (**GMM**) estimator, also called the **two-stage IV** estimator.^[@CAME:TRIV:05\index[author]{Cameron}\index[author]{Trivedi}, page 187.]

$$
\hat{\gamma} = \left(Z^\top W \hat{S}^{-1} W ^ \top Z\right)^{-1}Z^\top W \hat{S}^{-1} W ^ \top y
$$ {#eq-two_steps_iv}

Replacing $y$ in @eq-two_steps_iv by $Z\gamma + \epsilon$, we get:

$$
\hat{\gamma} = \gamma + \left(Z^\top W \hat{S}^{-1} W ^ \top Z\right)^{-1}Z^\top W \hat{S}^{-1} W ^ \top \epsilon
$$ 

which leads to the following covariance matrix:

$$
\hat{\mbox{V}}(\hat{\gamma}) = \left(Z^\top W \hat{S}^{-1} W ^ \top Z\right)^{-1}
$$

To estimate this covariance matrix, on can use an estimation of $S$
based on the residuals of the regression of the second step.

### An example: long term effects of slave trades

\idxdata[(]{slave\_trade}{countries}
Africa experienced poor economic performances during the second half of
the twentieth century, which can be explained by its experience of
slave trades and colonialism. In particular, slave trades may induce
long-term negative effects on the economic development of African
countries because of induced corruption, ethnic fragmentation and
weakening of established states. Africa experienced, between 1400
and 1900 four slave trades: the trans-Atlantic slaves trade (the most
important), but also the trans-Saharan, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean slave
trades. Not including those who died during the slave trade process,
about 18 millions slaves were exported from Africa. @NUNN:08\index[author]{Nunn} conducted
a quantitative analysis of the effects of slave trades on economic
performances, by regressing the 2000 GDP per capita of 52 African
countries on a measure of the level of slaves extraction. The
`slave_trade` data sate is provided by the **countries** package:

```{r }
#| label: slave_trades
sltd <- countries::slave_trade
```

The response is `gdp` and the main covariate is a measure of the level of
slaves extraction, which is the number of slaves normalized by the
area of the country. In @fig-gdp_slaves, we first use a scatterplot,
using log scales for both variables, which clearly indicates a
negative relationship between slaves extraction and per capita GDP in
2000. Note the use of `ggrepel::geom_label_repel`: **ggplot2** provides two geoms to draw labels (`geom_text` and `geom_label`) but the labels may overlap. `geom_label_repel` compute a position for the labels that prevent this overlapping.
\idxfun{ggplot}{ggplot2}\idxfun{aes}{ggplot2}\idxfun{scale\_x\_log10}{ggplot2}\idxfun{scale\_y\_log10}{ggplot2}\idxfun{geom\_smooth}{ggplot2}\idxfun{geom\_label\_repel}{ggrepel}

```{r }
#| message: false
#| label: fig-gdp_slaves
#| fig-cap: "Per capita gdp and slaves extraction"
sltd %>% ggplot(aes(slavesarea, gdp)) + geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") + 
    ggrepel::geom_label_repel(aes(label = country),
                              size = 2, max.overlaps = Inf)
```

@NUNN:08\index[author]{Nunn} in table 2 presents a series of linear regressions, with
different sets of controls. We just consider his first specification,
which includes only dummies for the colonizer as supplementary covariates:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: slave_trade_ols
#| collapse: true
slaves_ols <- lm(log(gdp) ~ log(slavesarea) + colony, sltd)
slaves_ols %>% gaze(coef = "log(slavesarea)")
```

The coefficient is negative and highly significant, it implies that a
10% increase of slaves extraction induce a reduction of 1% of GDP per
capita. 
As noticed by @NUNN:08\index[author]{Nunn}, the estimation of the effect of slaves trade
on GDP can be biased and inconsistent for two reasons:

- the level of slaves extraction, which is based on information of the
  ethnicity of individual slaves and then aggregated at the current countries
  level can be prone to error of measurement; moreover, for countries
  inside the continent (compared to coastal countries), a lot of
  slaves died during the journey to the coastal port of export, so
  that the level of extraction may be underestimated for these
  countries,
- the average economic conditions may be different for countries who
  suffered a large extraction, compared to the other; in particular,
  if countries where the trade was particularly important were poor,
  their current poor economic conditions
  can be explained by their poor economic conditions 600 years ago and
  not by slave trades.
  
Measurement error induces an attenuation bias, which means that without
measurement error, the negative effect of slave trades on GDP per
capita would be stronger. The second effect would induce an upward bias
(in absolute value) of the coefficient on slave trades. But, actually,
@NUNN:08\index[author]{Nunn} showed that areas of Africa that suffered the most of slave trades
were in general not the poorest areas, but the most developed ones. In
this case, the OLS estimator would under-estimate the effect of
slave trades on GDP per capita. 
@NUNN:08\index[author]{Nunn} then performs instrumental variable regressions, using as
instruments the distance between the centroid of the countries and the
closest major market for the 4 slave trades (for example Mauritius and
Oman for the Indian Ocean slave trade and Massawa, Suakin and
Djibouti for the Red Sea slave trade).
The IV regression can be performed by first regressing the
endogenous covariate on the external instruments (`atlantic`,
`indian`, `redsea` and `sahara`) and on the exogenous covariates (here
`colony`, the factor indicating the previous colonizer). This is the
so-called **first stage regression**:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}\idxfun{rsq}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: first_stage_slave
#| collapse: true
slaves_first <- lm(log(slavesarea) ~ atlantic + indian +
                       redsea + sahara, sltd)
slaves_first %>% gaze
slaves_first %>% rsq
```

Except for the `redsea` variable, the coefficients are highly
significant and the 4 instruments explain more than one fourth of the
variance of slave extraction. The second stage is obtained by
regressing the response on the fitted values of the first step
estimation:
\idxfun{add\_column}{tibble}\idxfun{fitted}{stats}\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: second_stage_slave
#| collapse: true
sltd <- sltd %>% add_column(hlslarea = fitted(slaves_first))
slaves_second <- lm(log(gdp) ~ hlslarea, sltd)
slaves_second %>% gaze
```

The coefficient has almost doubled, compared to the OLS estimator,
which confirms that this latter estimator is biased, with an
attenuation bias due to measurement error and a downward bias caused by the fact that the most developed African regions were more affected by slave trades. 
The 2-steps IV estimator is then computed. We use the **Formula** package
which enables to write complex formulas with multiple set of
variables, separated by the `|` operator:^[We've already presented briefly this package in @sec-sys_eq_ols.]
\idxfun{Formula}{Formula}

```{r }
#| label: Formula_slave
library(Formula)
form <- Formula(log(gdp) ~ log(slavesarea) |
                   redsea + atlantic + sahara + indian)
```

The first part contains the covariates, the second part the
instruments. We then compute the model frame and we extract the covariates, the instruments and the response:
\idxfun{model.frame}{stats}\idxfun{model.matrix}{stats}\idxfun{model.part}{Formula}\idxfun{pull}{dplyr}

```{r }
#| label: model_matrices_slave
mf <- model.frame(form, sltd)
W <- model.matrix(form, sltd, rhs = 2)
Z <- model.matrix(form, sltd, rhs = 1)
y <- model.part(form, mf, lhs = 1) %>% pull
```

We then compute the cross-products of the instruments and the covariates
($Z^\top W$) and $\hat{S}$
\idxfun{crossprod}{base}\idxfun{resid}{stats}\idxfun{solve}{base}\idxfun{t}{base}\idxfun{drop}{base}\idxfun{cbind}{base}\idxfun{stder}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: two_stage_iv
#| collapse: true
ZPW <- crossprod(Z, W)
S <- crossprod(abs(resid(slaves_second)) * W)
vcov_1 <- solve(ZPW %*% solve(S) %*% t(ZPW))
iv2s <- vcov_1 %*% (ZPW %*% solve(S) %*% crossprod(W, y)) %>% drop
resid2 <- (y - Z %*% iv2s) %>% drop
S2 <- crossprod(abs(resid2) * W)
vcov_2 <- solve(ZPW %*% solve(S2) %*% t(ZPW))
cbind(coef = iv2s, sd1 = stder(vcov_1),
      sd2 = stder(vcov_2))[2, ] %>% print(digits = 2)
```

The results are very similar to those of the one-step IV estimator. The
IV estimator can also be computed using the `ivreg::ivreg`
function. The main argument is a two-part formula, the first part
containing the covariates and the second part the instruments:
\idxfun{ivreg}{ivreg}

```{r }
#| results: false
#| eval: false
#| label: ivreg_slave_silent
ivreg::ivreg(log(gdp) ~ log(slavesarea) |
                 redsea + atlantic + sahara + indian, data = sltd)
```

The output of the `ivreg` function will be presented in @sec-test_sltr.

## Three stage least squares {#sec-three_sls}
\index[general]{three stage least squares|(}
\index[general]{instrumental variable estimator!three stage least squares|(}
\index[general]{system estimation!three stage least squares|(}

Consider now the case where the model is defined by a system of
equations, some of the covariates entering these equations being
endogenous.
We consider therefore a system of $L$ equations denoted
$y_l=Z_l\gamma_l+\epsilon_l$, with $l=1\ldots L$. This situation has already
be encountered in @sec-sys_eq_ols, @sec-bptest_system and @sec-sur. In this latter section, we
considered that all the covariates were exogenous and we presented the
seemingly unrelated regression estimator, which is a GLS estimator
that takes into account the correlation between the errors of the
different equations. Remind that, in matrix form, the system can be written as
follows:

$$
\left(
  \begin{array}{c}
    y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_L
  \end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
    Z_1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
    0 & Z_2 & \ldots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & \ldots & Z_L
  \end{array}
\right)
\left(
  \begin{array}{c}
    \gamma_1 \\ \gamma_2 \\ \vdots \\ \gamma_L
  \end{array}
\right)
+
\left(
  \begin{array}{c}
    \epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_L
  \end{array}
\right)
$$

And the covariance of the error vector for the whole system is assumed
to be:

$$
\Omega=
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
  \sigma_{11} I & \sigma_{12} I & \ldots &\sigma_{1L} I \\
  \sigma_{12} I & \sigma_{22} I & \ldots &\sigma_{2L} I \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  \sigma_{1L} I & \sigma_{2L} I & \ldots & \sigma_{LL} I
  \end{array}
\right)
= \Sigma \otimes I
$$

where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product\index[general]{Kronecker product}
and $\Sigma$ is a symmetric
matrix of dimensions $L$ for which the diagonal elements are the
variance of the errors for a given equation and the off-diagonal
elements the covariances between the pairs of errors of two different equations. 

### Computation of the 3SLS estimator

If some covariates are endogenous, we should consider, for each
equation, a matrix of instruments:

$$
W = 
\left(
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
    W_1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
    0 & W_2 & \ldots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & \ldots & W_L
  \end{array}
\right)
$$

The moment conditions for the whole system are then:

$$
m = 
\frac{1}{N}W^\top \epsilon=
\frac{1}{N}\left(
\begin{array}{c}
W_1 ^ \top \epsilon_1 \\
W_2 ^ \top \epsilon_2 \\
\vdots \\
W_L^\top \epsilon_L
\end{array}
\right)
$$

and the variance of the vector of moments is:

$$
\mbox{V}(m) = \frac{1}{N ^ 2}\mbox{E}\left(m m ^ \top\right) =
W ^ \top \mbox{E}\left(\epsilon \epsilon ^ \top\right) W =
W ^ \top \Omega W = W ^ \top (\Sigma \otimes I) W
$$

The **three stage least squares** estimator^[@ZELL:THEI:62.\index[author]{Zellner}\index[author]{Theil}] (**3SLS** in short) minimizes the quadratic form
of the moments with the inverse of this variance matrix:

$$
m ^ \top (W ^ \top \Omega W) ^ {-1} m = (y - Z \gamma) ^ \top (W ^ \top
\Omega W) ^ {-1} (y - Z \gamma)
$$

which leads to the following estimator:

$$
\hat{\gamma} = \left(Z ^ \top W (W ^ \top \Omega W) ^ {-1} W ^ \top
Z\right) ^ {-1}
\left(Z ^ \top W (W ^ \top \Omega W) ^ {-1} W ^ \top y\right)
$$ {#eq-threesls}

This estimator can actually be computed using least squares on
transformed data. Denote $\Psi = \Sigma ^ {- 0.5} \otimes I$ the
matrix such that $\Psi ^ \top \Psi = \Sigma ^ {-1} \otimes I = \Omega
^ {-1}$. Then, pre-multiply the covariates and the response by $\Psi$
and the instruments by $(\Psi^{-1}) ^ \top$. Then the projection
matrix of $\tilde{W} = {\Psi^{-1}} ^ \top W$ is:

$$
P_{\tilde{W}} = (\Psi^{-1}) ^ \top W\left(W ^ \top \Psi ^ {-1} (\Psi ^ {-1})
^ \top W\right) ^ {-1} W ^ \top \Psi^{-1}
$$

but $\Psi ^ {-1} (\Psi ^ {-1}) ^ \top = \Psi ^ {-1} (\Psi ^ \top ) ^
{-1} = (\Psi ^ \top \Psi) ^ {-1} = \Omega$. Therefore:

$$
P_{\tilde{W}} = (\Psi^{-1}) ^ \top W \left(W ^ \top \Omega W\right) ^ {-1} W ^ \top \Psi^{-1}
$$

The transformed covariates and response are $\tilde{Z} = \Psi Z$ and
$\tilde{y} = \Psi y$, so that performing the instrumental variable
estimator on the transformed data, we get:

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\gamma} &=& \left(\tilde{Z}^\top P_{\tilde{W}} \tilde{Z}\right) ^
{-1} \left(\tilde{Z}^\top P_{\tilde{W}} \tilde{y}\right) \\
&=& \left(Z ^ \top \Psi ^ \top (\Psi^{-1}) ^ \top W \left(W ^ \top \Omega
W\right) ^ {-1} W ^ \top \Psi^{-1} \Psi Z\right) ^ {-1} \\
&\times & \left(Z ^ \top \Psi ^ \top (\Psi^{-1}) ^ \top W \left(W ^ \top \Omega
W\right) ^ {-1} W ^ \top \Psi^{-1} \Psi y\right) \\
&=& \left(Z ^ \top W (W ^ \top \Omega W) ^ {-1} W ^ \top Z\right)^ {-1}
\left(Z ^ \top W (W ^ \top \Omega W) ^ {-1} W ^ \top y\right)
\end{array}
$$

which is @eq-threesls. Therefore, the 3SLS estimator can be
computed the following way:

1. First compute the 2SLS estimator and retrieve the vectors of
   residuals ($\hat{\Xi} = (\hat{\epsilon}_1, \ldots, \hat{\epsilon}_L)$).
1. Estimate $\Sigma$ using the cross-products of the vectors of residuals:
   $\hat{\Sigma} = \hat{\Xi} ^ \top \hat{\Xi} / N$,
1. Use the Cholesky decomposition of $\hat{\Sigma} ^ {-1}$ to get $V =
   \hat{\Sigma} ^ {-0.5}$, such that $V ^ \top V = \Sigma ^ {-1}$,
1. Premultiply the covariates and the response by $\hat{\Psi} = V \otimes
   I$ and the instruments by $\left(\hat{\Psi} ^ {-1}\right) ^
   {\top} = (V ^ {-1}) ^ \top \otimes I$,
1. Regress the transformed covariates on the transformed instruments
   and retrieve the fitted values,
1. Regress the transformed response on the fitted values of the
   previous regression.

### An example: the watermelon market

\idxdata[(]{watermelon}{micsr.data}
@SUIT:55\index[author]{Suit} built an econometric model of the watermelon market, using a
time-series for the United-States and his study was complemented by
@WOLD:58\index[author]{Wold} who rebuilt the data set. This data set (called `watermelon`) is a good example of
the use of system estimation with endogeneity and its use for teaching
purposes is advocated by @STEW:19\index[author]{Stewart}:

```{r }
#| label: watermelon
watermelon %>% print(n = 2)
```

On the supply side, two quantities of watermelons are distinguished: `q` are crop of watermelons available for harvest (millions) and `h` are watermelons actually harvested (millions). 
`q` depends on planting decisions made on information of the previous
season; more specifically, `q` depends on lag values of the average farm price of watermelon `p` (in  dollars per thousand), the average annual net farm price per pound of cottons `pc` (in dollars), the average farm price of vegetables `pv` (an index) and on two dummy variables for government cotton acreage allotment program `d1` (1 for the 1934-1951 period) and for world war 2 `d2` (1 for 1943-1946).

The amount of watermelons actually harvested `h` depends on current
price farm of watermelons `p`, wages `w` (the major cost of
harvesting) and is of course bounded by `q`, the amount of watermelon
available for harvest. More specifically, the relative price of
watermelon and wage is considered. 
On the demand side, farm price depends on per capita harvest, per
capita income (`yn`) and transportation cost (`pf`). An inverse
demand function is estimated, of the form:

$$
p = \alpha + \beta_q q + \beta_r r + \ldots
$$

and, all the variables being in logarithm, the price and income elasticities are therefore respectively $1 / \beta_q$ and $- \beta_r / \beta_q$. We compute the relative price of
watermelons in terms of wage (`pw`), the income per capita (`yn`) and
harvest (`hn`) and the first lags for `p`, `pc` and `pv`. We also
remove the first and the last observation (because of the lag for the
first one and because of missing value for `pv` and `w` for the last
one).
\idxfun{mutate}{dplyr}\idxfun{lag}{dplyr}\idxfun{filter}{dplyr}

```{r }
#| label: waltermelon_covariates
wm <- watermelon %>%
    mutate(yn = y - n, hn = h - n,
           pw = p - w, lp = lag(p),
           lpc = lag(pc), lpv = lag(pv)) %>%
    filter(! year %in% c(1930, 1951))
```

We can now define the set of three equations:

```{r }
#| label: equations_watermelon
eq_c <- q ~ lp + lpc + lpv + d1 + d2
eq_s <- h ~ pw + q
eq_d <- p ~ hn + yn + pf
```

The exogenous variables are `w`, `n`, `yn`, `pf`, `d1`, `d2` and the
lagged values of the price of watermelons (`lp`), cotton (`lpc`) and
vegetables (`lpv`). We form a one side formula for this set of
instruments:

```{r }
#| label: eq_inst_watermelon
eq_inst <- ~ w + n + yn + lp + pf + d1 + d2 + lpc + lpv
```
We then extract the three matrices of covariates, the matrix of
instruments and the matrix of responses:
\idxfun{model.matrix}{stats}\idxfun{nrow}{base}\idxfun{select}{dplyr}\idxfun{as.matrix}{base}

```{r }
#| label: model_matrices_watermelon
W <- model.matrix(eq_inst, wm)
X1 <- model.matrix(eq_c, wm)
X2 <- model.matrix(eq_s, wm)
X3 <- model.matrix(eq_d, wm)
N <- nrow(W)
Y <- select(wm, q, h, p) %>% as.matrix
```

We first compute the 2SLS estimator, using the **systemfit** package:
\idxfun{systemfit}{systemfit}

```{r }
#| label: twosls_watermelon
#| message: false
library(systemfit)
twosls <- systemfit(list(crop = eq_c, supply = eq_s, demand = eq_d),
                    inst = eq_inst, method = "2SLS", data = wm)
```

From this consistent, but inefficient estimator, we extract the data frame of residuals (one column per equation, one line per observation), we coerce it to a matrix and
we estimate the matrix of covariance for the system of equation ($\Sigma$):
\idxfun{crossprod}{base}\idxfun{as.matrix}{base}\idxfun{resid}{stats}

```{r }
#| label: estimation_sigma
Sigma <- crossprod(as.matrix(resid(twosls))) / N
```

We then compute `V` using the Cholesky decomposition of the inverse of
$\Sigma$:
\idxfun{solve}{base}\idxfun{chol}{base}

```{r }
#| label: cholesky_sigma
V <- Sigma %>% solve %>% chol
```

Using $V$, we apply the relevant transformation for the response and
for the covariate:
\idxfun{rbind}{base}\idxfun{cbind}{base}\idxfun{t}{base}\idxfun{as.numeric}{base}

```{r }
#| label: transformed_variables_watermelon
Xt <- rbind(cbind(V[1, 1] * X1, V[1, 2] * X2, V[1, 3] * X3),
            cbind(V[2, 1] * X1, V[2, 2] * X2, V[2, 3] * X3),
            cbind(V[3, 1] * X1, V[3, 2] * X2, V[3, 3] * X3))
yt <- Y %*% t(V) %>% as.numeric
```

We then apply the transformation for the instruments, using $\left(V ^
{-1}\right) ^ \top$. The matrix of instruments being the same for all
the equations, the transformation can be obtained more simply using
a Kronecker product:
\idxfun{t}{base}\idxfun{solve}{base}

```{r }
#| label: instrument_matrix_watermelon
Wt <- t(solve(V)) %x% W
```

Then, 2SLS is performed by first regressing `Zt` on `Xt`:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}

```{r }
#| label: first_stage_watermelon
first <- lm(Xt ~ Wt - 1)
```

and then by regressing the fitted values of this first step regression
on the transformed response:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{fitted}{stats}

```{r }
#| label: second_stage_watermelon
second <- lm(yt ~ fitted(first) - 1)
```

Identical results are obtained using `systemfit` and setting `method`
to `"3SLS"`:^[As for the SUR model estimated in @sec-sur, we set the `methodResidCov` argument to `"noDfCor"`, so that no degrees of freedom correction is used for the estimation of the covariance matrix of the errors.]
\idxfun{coef}{stats}\idxfun{systemfit}{systemfit}

```{r }
#| label: threesls_watermelon
threesls <- systemfit(list(crop = eq_c, supply = eq_s,
                           demand = eq_d), inst = eq_inst,
                      method = "3SLS", data = wm,
                      methodResidCov=  "noDfCor")
coef(threesls)
```

```{r}
#| label: threesls_hide
#| include: false
s_p <- coef(threesls)["supply_pw"]
d_q <- coef(threesls)["demand_hn"]
d_y <- coef(threesls)["demand_yn"]
```

The relative price of watermelon is significantly positive in
the supply equation, with a value of `r round(s_p, 2)` which is the
price elasticity of supply. In the inverse demand function, the
coefficients of per capita quantity of watermelons and of per capita
income have the expected sign (respectively negative and positive) and
are highly significant. The estimated price and income elasticities
are $1 / `r round(d_q, 2)` = `r round(1 / d_q, 2)`$ and $- `r round(d_y, 2)` / `r round(d_q, 2)` = `r round(- d_y / d_q, 2)`$.

## Fixed effects model {#sec-fixed_effects}
\index[general]{fixed effects model|(}
\index[general]{panel data!fixed effects model|(}

In @sec-error_component, we developed the error component model for panel or pseudo-panel data sets. Remind that when we have several observations ($t$) for the same entities ($n$), the simple linear model can be written:

$$
y_{nt} = \alpha + \beta x_{nt} + \epsilon_{nt} = \alpha + \beta x_{nt} + \eta_n + \nu_{nt}
$$
the error term being the sum of two components: an entity / individual effect $\eta_n$ and an idiosyncratic effect $\nu_{nt}$. In 
@sec-error_component, we assumed that $x$ was uncorrelated with $\epsilon_{nt}$. OLS was still a consistent estimator, by the BLUE estimator was GLS which takes into account the correlation between errors of the observations of the same entity / individual caused by the presence of a common individual effect $\eta_n$. Consider now that $x$ is endogenous; the OLS and GLS estimators are then  is biased and inconsistent. Now consider the case where $x$ is correlated only $\eta$:
$\mbox{E}(\eta \mid x) \neq 0$ but $\mbox{E}(\nu \mid x) = 0$. In
this case, unbiased and consistent OLS estimators can be obtained
when the individual effect $\eta$ is either estimated or if the
estimation is performed on a transformation of the covariate and the
response that removes the individual effect. This is called the **fixed
effect** estimator. 

### Computation of the fixed effect estimator

The linear model: $y_{nt} = \beta^\top x_{nt} + \eta_n + \nu_{nt}$ can be written in matrix form as:

$$
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
y_{11}\\
y_{12}\\
\vdots\\
y_{1T} \\
y_{21}\\
y_{22}\\
\vdots\\
y_{2T}\\
\vdots\\
y_{N1}\\
y_{N2}\\
\vdots\\
y_{NT}
\end{array}
\right) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
x_{11}^\top\\
x_{12}^\top\\
\vdots\\
x_{1T}^\top\\
x_{21}^\top\\
x_{22}^\top\\
\vdots\\
x_{2T}^\top\\
\vdots\\
x_{N1}^\top\\
x_{N2}^\top\\
\vdots\\
x_{NT}^\top
\end{array}
\right)
\beta
+ 
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 1 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 \\
0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\eta_1 \\
\eta_2 \\
\vdots \\
\eta_N
\end{array}
\right)+
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\nu_{11}\\
\nu_{12}\\
\vdots\\
\nu_{1T} \\
\nu_{21}\\
\nu_{22}\\
\vdots\\
\nu_{2T}\\
\vdots\\
\nu_{N1}\\
\nu_{N2}\\
\vdots\\
\nu_{NT}
\end{array}
\right)
$$
or:

$$
y = X \beta + D \eta + \nu
$$
Note that this model doesn't contain an intercept: as $\eta$ are considered as parameters to be estimated, with an intercept $\alpha$, only $N$ parameters like $\alpha + \eta_n$ can be estimated and therefore, $\alpha$ can safely be set to 0.
$D = j_T \otimes I_N$ is a $NT\times N$ matrix where each column contains a dummy variable for one individual. The **least squares dummy variable** estimator (**LSDV** in short) 
\index[general]{panel data!least squares dummy variable}
\index[general]{least squares dummy variable estimator}
consists on estimating by least squares $\beta$ and $\eta$. Instead of estimating the $N$ $\eta$ parameters, it is simpler and more efficient to use the Frisch-Waugh theorem: first $X$ and $y$ are regressed on $D$, then the residuals of the first regression of $y$ are regressed on those of $X$.

The OLS estimate of a variable $z$ on $D$ is: $\hat{\delta} = (D ^ \top D) ^ {-1} D^\top z$. But $D^\top D =  T I$, so that $(D ^ \top D) ^ {-1} = I / T$. Moreover:

$$
D^\top z = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
\sum_t z_{1t} \\
\sum_t z_{2t} \\
\vdots \\
\sum_t z_{Nt} \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
and therefore $\hat{\delta}$ is a vector of individual mean of $z$, with typical element $\hat{\delta}_n = \bar{z}_{n.} = \sum_t z_{nt} / T$. Therefore, applying the Frisch-Waugh theorem implies that regressing $y$ on $X$ and $D$ is equivalent to regress $y$ on $X$ with both the response and the covariates measured in deviations from their individual means. For one observation, we have: $y_{nt} = \beta^\top x_{nt} + \eta_n + \nu_{nt}$. Taking the individual mean of this equation, we get: $\bar{y}_{n.} = \beta^\top \bar{x}_{n.} + \eta_n + \bar{\nu}_{n.}$. Taking deviations from the individual means, the model to estimate is then:

$$
y_{nt} - \bar{y}_{n.} = \beta ^ \top (x_{nt} - \bar{x}_{n.}) + (\nu_{nt} - \bar{\nu}_{n.})
$$

Therefore, if $x$ is correlated with $\eta$, but not with $\nu$, the OLS estimator of this model is consistent because the error doesn't contain $\eta$ anymore and is therefore uncorrelated with $x$. This model is called the **fixed effects** model and also the **within** model in the panel data literature. With a single regressor, the estimator of the unique slope is:
\index[general]{panel data!within estimator}
\index[general]{within estimator}
$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{n=1} ^ N \sum_{t = 1} ^ T (y_{nt} - \bar{y}_{n.})(x_{nt} - \bar{x}_{n.})}
{\sum_{n=1} ^ N \sum_{t = 1} ^ T (x_{nt} - \bar{x}_{n.}) ^ 2}
$$ {#eq-within_est}

The deviation from individual means is obviously not the only transformation that enables to get rid of the individual effects. Consider the special case where $T = 2$ for all individuals. An interesting example of this particular case is samples of twins. In this case:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{rcl}
y_{n1} = \beta x_{n1} + \eta_n + \nu_{n1} \\
y_{n2} = \beta x_{n2} + \eta_n + \nu_{n2} \\
\end{array}
\right.
$$
And the difference between the two equations enables to get rid of the individual effect:

$$
y_{n1} - y_{n2} = \beta(x_{n1} -x_{n2}) + \nu_{n1} - \nu_{n2}
$$

The least square estimator of the slope is the following **first-difference** estimator:
\index[general]{first-difference estimator}
\index[general]{panel data!first-difference estimator}

$$
\hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_n(y_{n1} - y_{n2})(x_{n1} - x_{n2})}{\sum_n(x_{n1} - x_{n2})}
$$
which is in this case identical to the **within** estimator. This result can be established by remarking that the numerator of @eq-within_est is a sum of $N$ terms of the form: 

$$
(y_{n1} - \bar{y}_{n.})(x_{n1} - \bar{x}_{n.})+(y_{n2} - \bar{y}_{n.})(x_{n2} - \bar{x}_{n.})
$$
But $z_{n1} - \bar{z}_{n.} = z_{n1} - \frac{1}{2}(z_{n1} + z_{n2}) = \frac{1}{2}(z_{n1} - z_{n2})$. Similarly, $z_{n2} - \bar{z}_{n.} = -\frac{1}{2}(z_{n1} - z_{n2})$. Therefore, each term in the numerator of @eq-within_est reduces to $\frac{1}{2} (y_{n1} - y_{n2})(x_{n1} - x_{n2})$ and similarly, each term in the denominator reduce to $\frac{1}{2}(x_{n1} - x_{n2}) ^ 2$ which proves the equivalence between the first-difference and the within estimator. When $T > 2$ the within and the first-difference estimators differ:

- the within estimator is more efficient, as it uses all the observations; on the contrary, while performing the first difference, the first observation for every individual is lost,
- the error of the within estimator is $\nu_{nt} - \bar{\nu}_{n.}$ and therefore contains the whole series of $\nu_n$; on the contrary, the error of the first-difference is $\nu_{nt} - \nu_{n(t-1)}$ and therefore contains the values of $\nu_n$ only for the current and the for previous period.

### Application: Mincer earning function using a sample of twins

\idxdata[(]{twins}{micsr.data}
In @sec-error_component_gls, we've estimated a Mincer earning function using the `twins` data set.
\idxfun{mutate}{dplyr}\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: twins_bonjour
twins <- twins %>% mutate(age2 = age ^ 2 / 100)
lm(log(earning) ~ educ + age + age2, twins) %>% gaze
```

The estimated return of education is about 7.7%, but may be biased if
the error is correlated with education. In particular, "abilities" are
unobserved and may be correlated with education. If this correlation
is positive, then the OLS estimator is upward biased. The solution
here is to consider that abilities should be similar for the two twins,
as they are genetically identical and had the same familial
environment. In this case, the fixed effect model can be performed. It
can be obtained either by: estimating coefficients for all family dummies, using OLS on the within transformed variables or using OLS on the differences.
Note that identical twins have obviously the same age, so that this
covariate disappears in the fixed effect model. Let's start with the
LSDV estimator:
\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{coef}{stats}\idxfun{head}{utils}\idxfun{factor}{base}

```{r }
#| label: lsdv_twins
#| collapse: true
lsdv <- lm(log(earning) ~ educ + factor(family), twins)
lsdv %>% coef %>% head(4)
lsdv %>% coef %>% length
```

The estimated return of education is much lower (3.9%) than the
OLS estimator. Note that numerous parameters are estimated (215)
and the computation can be unfeasible if the number of entities is very
large. Whatever the size of the sample, it is simpler and more efficient to use OLS on the
transformed data, either using the within or the first difference
estimator. This can easily be done using:
\idxfun{group\_by}{dplyr}\idxfun{mutate}{dplyr}\idxfun{lm}{stats}

```{r }
#| label: within_twins_manual 
#| collapse: true
twins %>% group_by(family) %>%
    mutate(learning = log(earning) - mean(log(earning)),
           educ = educ - mean(educ)) %>%
    lm(formula = learning ~ educ - 1) %>% coef
```

or:
\idxfun{summarise}{dplyr}\idxfun{group\_by}{dplyr}\idxfun{diff}{base}\idxfun{lm}{stats}\idxfun{coef}{stats}

```{r }
#| label: first_diff_twins_manual
#| collapse: true
twins %>% group_by(family) %>%
    summarise(learning = diff(log(earning)),
              educ = diff(educ)) %>%
    lm(formula = learning ~ educ - 1) %>% coef
```

In both cases, we grouped the rows by family, ie there are 214 groups
of two lines, one for each pair of twins. In the first case, we use
`mutate` to remove the individual mean; for example, `mean(educ)` is
the mean of education computed for every family and is repeated two
times, and we therefore have 428 observations (one for each
individual). In the second case, we use `sumarise` and we therefore
get 214 observations (one for each family), the response and the
covariate being the twin difference of earning and education.

### Application: Testing the Tobin's Q theory of investment using panel data

@SCHA:90\index[author]{Schaller} tested the relevance of Tobin's Q theory of investment by
regressing the investment rate (the ratio of the investment and the
stock of capital) to Tobin's Q, which is the ratio of the value of the
firm and the stock of capital. This data set has already been
In @sec-error_component_gls, we've estimated by GLS an investment equation using the Tobin's Q theory of investment. We consider now the estimation of a fixed effects model. It is obtained using `plm` (of the **plm** package)
by setting the `model` argument to `"within"` (which is actually the
default value). 
\idxdata[(]{tobinq}{micsr.data}
\idxfun{plm}{plm}\idxfun{summary}{base}

```{r }
#| label: tobinq_within
#| message: false
library(plm)
qw <- plm(ikn ~ qn, tobinq)
qw %>% summary
```

The individual effects are not estimated because the estimator
use the within transformation and then performs OLS on transformed
data. However, the individual effects can be computed easily because:
$\hat{\eta}_n = \bar{y}_{n.} - \hat{\beta} ^ \top \bar{x}_{n.}$. The
`fixef` method for `plm` objects retrieve the fixed effects and a
`type` argument can be set to:

- `"level"`: the effects are then the same as those obtained
  by LSDV without intercept,
- `"dfirst"`: only $N - 1$ effects are estimated, the first one being
  set to 0; these are the effects obtained by LSDV with an
  intercept,
- `"dmean"`: $N$ effects and an overall intercept is estimated, but
  the $N$ effects have a 0 mean.
\idxfun{fixef}{plm}\idxfun{head}{utils}

There is a `summary` method that reports the usual table of
coefficients for the effects:

## Specification tests {#sec-tests_endog}

### Hausman test
\index[general]{Hausman test|(} 

Models estimated in this chapter, either using the IV or the fixed effects
estimator, treat the endogeneity of some covariates, either by using
instruments or by removing individual effects. These estimates are
consistent if some covariates are actually endogenous although other
estimators like OLS or GLS are not. However, if endogeneity is
actually not a problem, this latter estimators are also consistent and
are moreover more efficient. The Hausman test is based on the
comparison of these two estimators and on the null hypothesis of the absence of endogeneity:

- $\hat{\beta}_0$, with variance $\hat{V}_0$ is only consistent if the hypothesis is
true and is in this case efficient,
- $\hat{\beta}_1$, with variance $\hat{V}_1$ is always consistent, but
  is less efficient than $\hat{\beta}_0$ if the hypothesis is true.

@HAUS:78's\index[author]{Hausman} test is based on $\hat{q} = \hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_0$,
for which the variance is: 
$$
\mbox{V}(\hat{q}) =
\mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_1) + \mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_0) - 2
\mbox{cov}(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_0)
$$ {#eq-var_difference}

He showed that the covariance between $\hat{q}$ and
$\hat{\beta}_0$ is 0. Therefore:

$$ 
\mbox{cov}(\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_0) =
\mbox{cov}(\hat{\beta}_1, \hat{\beta}_0) + \mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_0) = 0
$$

and therefore @eq-var_difference simplifies to: $\mbox{V}(\hat{q}) =
\mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_1) - \mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_0)$. The asymptotic
distribution of the difference of the two vectors of estimates is,
under H~0~:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_0 \overset{a}{\sim} \mathcal{N} \left(0, \mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_1) - \mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_0)\right)
$$

and therefore $(\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_0) ^ \top \left(\mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_1) -
\mbox{V}(\hat{\beta}_0)\right) ^ {-1} (\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_0)$
is a $\chi ^ 2$ with degrees of freedom equal to the number of
estimated parameters. Note that the length of $\hat{\beta}_0$ and
$\hat{\beta}_1$ may be different. This is the case for panel data with
individual specific covariates which are estimated using OLS or
GLS but which are not with the within estimator. In this case, the
test should be performed on the subset of common parameters. For tests
involving OLS and IV estimator, the test can also be performed
only on the subset of parameters associated with covariates that are
suspected to be endogenous.
\index[general]{Hausman test|)} 

### Weak instruments

Instruments should be not only uncorrelated with the error of the
model, but they should also be correlated with the covariates. We have
seen in @sec-ssprop_iv that the expected value of the IV estimator
doesn't exist when there is only one instrument. It exists if the
number of instruments is at least 2 and in this case, it can be shown
that the bias of the IV estimator is approximately inversely
proportional to the F statistic of the regression of the endogenous
variable on the instruments.^[See @BOUN:JAEG:BAKE:95\index[author]{Bound}\index[author]{Jaeger}\index[author]{Baker} and @CAME:TRIV:05\index[author]{Cameron}\index[author]{Trivedi} pages 108-109 for a
discussion and further references.] Therefore, if the correlation between the
endogenous variable and the instruments is weak, ie if the IV is
performed using **weak instruments**, the estimator will not only be
highly imprecise, but it will also be seriously biased, in
the direction of the OLS estimator. While performing IV
estimation it is therefore important to check that the instruments are
sufficiently correlated with the endogenous covariate. This can be
performed using an F test for the first stage regression, comparing
the fit for the regression of the endogenous covariates on the set of the exogenous covariates and on the set of the exogenous covariates and on the external instruments.
A rule of thumb often used is that the F statistic should be at least
equal to 10 to unsure that the maximal bias of the IV estimator is no
more than 10% that of OLS. A less strict rule is $F > 5$.
\index[general]{weak instruments test}
\index[general]{F statistic!weak instruments}


### Sargan test
\index[general]{Sargan test}

The IV can be obtained as a moment estimator, using moment
conditions $m = W ^ \top \epsilon / N$. If the instruments are relevant,
they are uncorrelated with the errors, so that $m \overset{a}{\sim}
\mathcal{N}(0, V)$ and $S = m ^ \top V ^ {-1} m$  is a $\chi^2$ with a
degree of freedom equal to the number of instruments. In the
just-identified case, $m=0$, but in the over identified case, this
statistic is positive and the hypothesis of orthogonal instruments
implies that $m$ is close enough to a vector of 0 or that $S$ is
sufficiently small.

### Individual effects
\index[general]{F statistic!individual effects}

In the fixed effect model, the absence of individual effects can be
tested using a standard $F$ test that all the estimated individual
effects are zero. More simply, it can be obtained by comparing the
sum of squares residuals of the OLS and the fixed effects models.

$$
\frac{SCR_{\mbox{OLS}} - SCR_{\mbox{FE}}}{SCR_{\mbox{FE}}} \times \frac{N (T - 1) - K }{N -
1} \sim F_{N-1, N (T - 1) - K}
$$

### Panel application: Testing the Tobin's Q theory of investment
 
The presence of individual effects was already tested using a score
test based on the OLS residuals. We compute here a F test, using `plm::pFtest`:
\idxdata[(]{tobinq}{micsr.data}
\idxfun{pFtest}{plm}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: pFtest_tobinq
#| collapse: true
pFtest(ikn ~ qn, tobinq) %>% gaze
```

and the hypothesis is strongly rejected. Once we have concluded that there are individual effects, the question is whether these effects
are correlated with the covariates or not. If this is the case, the fixed
effects model should be used because the GLS model is
inconsistent. On the contrary, both models are consistent and the
GLS estimator, which is more efficient, should be used.
\idxfun{phtest}{plm}\idxfun{gaze}{micsr}

```{r }
#| label: phtest_tobinq
#| collapse: true
phtest(ikn ~ qn, tobinq) %>% gaze

The hypothesis of uncorrelated individual effects is not rejected at
the 5%, which leads to the choice of the GLS estimator.

### Instrumental variable application: slave trade {#sec-test_sltr}

\idxdata[(]{slave\_trade}{countries}
The IV estimator for the `slave_trade` data set was presented in @sec-test_sltr. We use
this time the `ivreg::ivreg` functions, which computes all the
relevant specification tests.
\idxfun{ivreg}{ivreg}\idxfun{summary}{base}

```{r }
#| label: ivreg_slave
sltd_iv <- ivreg::ivreg(log(gdp) ~ log(slavesarea) | 
                          redsea + atlantic + sahara + indian, 
                        data = sltd)
summary(sltd_iv)
```

The F statistic for the first stage regression is only $4.54$, so that
the instruments can be considered as weak and we can suspect the IV
estimator to be severely biased. Anyway, remind that the bias is in
the direction of the OLS estimator so that the effect of slave trades
on current GDP would be underestimated. The p-value for the Hausman
test is $0.02$ so that the exogeneity hypothesis of the covariate is
rejected at the 5% level, but not at the 1% level. Finally, as there
are 4 instruments, the Sargan statistic, which is the quadratic form
of the 4 moment conditions with the inverse of its variance is $4.89$
and is a $\chi ^ 2$ with 3 degrees of freedom if the instruments are
valid. This hypothesis is not rejected, even at the 10% level.
